The following sketches have been—I hope I may
say without presumption—carefully drawn up, from
the best authorities within my reach. I have tried to
give Welsh proper names correctly; but as I have not
the happiness to be acquainted with the primitive and
beautiful language of the Cymry, I trust that my
readers of the Principality will kindly overlook errors
in this respect.

The kind reader who has accompanied me in my former
travels, will not, I hope, turn away as from a trite and
wornout theme, when I invite him to British ground, and in the
same spirit, with the same intention that characterised my
former essays, and after a somewhat similar fashion, put
together, as concisely as the subject will permit, a few
sketches on the chief matters of historical interest, civil and
ecclesiastical, but chiefly the latter, belonging to the country,
and comprised within the period assigned; commencing in a
remote antiquity, and continued to the close of the twelfth
century. My confined limits leave room for little in the way
of prefatory observation, so to begin.

The Deluge, when all the fountains of the great deep
were broken up, the windows of heaven opened, the waters
covered the whole earth, and everything that had breath
perished, the few excepted whom the ark providentially
saved, is a fact recorded in the oldest book extant—tlie
Bible, and confirmed by the researches of those who have
made the natural history of our globe their study. This

  BARDISM.

evidence ranges over a wide field, and is full of interest; but
there is another body of proof not so thoroughly worked
out, which scarcely yields to the former in value and
conclusiveness—I mean that derived from an investigation of
the ancient forms of religion, not claiming direct inspiration.
A flood of waters in which a single family was wonderfully
preserved, while the whole human race beside perished, was
a tradition of heathen mythology, and constituted the base
of that particular system of old faith with which I am at
present concerned—Bardism. The Bardic Institutions were
spread over England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Germany,
uniform in their leading principles, differing in detail
according to local tradition and usages. I confine myself to
Bardism as it presented itself in Wales.

That the powers of the mind were highly cultivated
under the system I shall attempt to describe, abundant
evidence will be given by and by; one valuable faculty, it
suffices to say now, was assiduously cultivated and improved—
memory. Not from inability to commit their ideas to writing,
—for the Bards possessed a sacred alphabet—their doctrines
and precepts were transmitted from generation to
generation, treasured in the recollection of their disciples. In
order to remember accurately, we ought to have the things
put before us in a compact form. To this indispensable
point remarkable attention was paid. The principle of the
Bardic Memoria technica was the number Three. This
number has been always held in peculiar veneration. " It
forms," as some philosopher has said, "a kind of limit to the
natural powers of repeated exertion, an idea so far, at least,
founded in nature, as to have become a favourite with the
poets of all ages." Oral instructions cast into this mould
received the name of Triads; a number of which, divided for
convenience into different classes, as they relate to history,
poetry, theology, ethics, and jurisprudence, are still extant.
In the decline of Bardism, memory less diligently cultivated
was felt to be a precarious depositary. The Triads were,
therefore, written down. The oldest MSS. are supposed to
have been collected as early as the seventh century. Such
was the opinion of a distinguished Welsh antiquary, Mr.
Vaughan of Hengwrt; but the testimony of the copyists of
the Welsh MSS. does not go higher than the tenth century.
<!-- Leaf 17, Page: 3 -->
The ancient Triads were principally collected during the
twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries.


Of three awful events of the Isle of Britain, the first and
greatest was, " The bursting of the lake of waters, and the
overwhelming the face of all lands; so that all mankind
were drowned, excepting Dwyvan and Dwyvach, who
escaped in a naked vessel (without sails); and of them the
Island of Britain was re-peopled." * Among the
masterworks or great achievements of the same renowned island,
figure prominently " The ship of Nevydd Nav Neivion,
which carried in it a male and a female ofall living, when
the lake of waters burst forth," and "the drawing the Afanc
to land out ofthe lake by the branching oxen of Hu Gadarn,
so that the lake burst no more."*)- The Afanc will keep till
we come to him again; but to Hu Gadarn we must pay due
observance. He was the great leader, hero, lawgiver; and,
earthly honours exhausted, representative deity ofthe Cymry.
"Hu the Mighty first showed the method of ploughing
land to the nation of the Cymry, when they were in the
country of the summer, before their coming into the Isle of
Britain." J "Hu the Mighty originally conducted the nation
of the Cymry into the Isle of Britain." § "The nation of
the Cymry came with Hu the Mighty into the Isle of Britain,
because he would not possess lands and dominion by fighting
and pursuit, but through justice and in peace." || "Hu the
Mighty first formed mote and retinue for the nation of the
Cymry." 1T That is, he put into a good system those matters
of great moment to nomadic tribes; their removal from
place to place, and protection against sudden attacks and
surprises when on their march.

\"Hu the Mighty first applied vocal song to the preserving
of memor)' and record." ** Taliesin, wbo wrote in the sixth
century, describes him as "the dispenser of good, the
proprietor and rightful claimant of Britain." f-f* The personage
to whom are ascribed these various titles to honour and
veneration, is believed by Davies, Meyrick, and other standard
authorities, to have been no other than the Patriarch Noah.

<!-- Leaf 18, Page: 4 -->

Having reached this point, the subject easily and
appropriately branches out into three divi-rions: first, the religious
ideas and doctrines of Bardism; secondly, the sacred orders;
thirdly, the rites and ceremonies. The deified Patriarch
was not left alone in his glory; his spouse, elevated to the
rank of a goddess, shared his rule. She appears under the
name Ked (Ark), Ceridwen, &c. The symbol of Hu was an
ox; that of Ceridwen, a cow and a boat. The Oriental
worship of the heavenly bodies was superadded : but to stay
dreadful jealousies from celestial minds, Hu the Mighty
received the homage paid to the sun, and Ceridwen that
addressed to the moon. There were subordinate deities.
For instance, there were three Bull Demons of Britain;
Ellyl Gwidawl, the demon of the whirling stream; Ellyl
Llyr Merini, the demon of the flowing sea; EUyl
Gurthmwl Wledig, the demon of the sovereign of the
equiponderate mass (the earth).

With these poetical and superstitious fancies were
blended many striking and lofty conceptions of the Divine
nature. As " God cannot be matter, what is not matter
must be God. There are three primary unities, and more
than one of each cannot exist: one God, one truth, and one
point of liberty; and this is where all opposites equally
equipreponderate. Three things it is impossible God should not
be, — whatever perfect goodness should be, whatever perfect
goodness would desire to be, whatever perfect goodness is
able to perform. Three things it is impossible God should
not perform,—what is most beneficial, what is most wanted,
and what is most beautiful of all things." *


Bardism taught the doctrine of the transmigration of
souls. Cæsar finds the origin of this belief in an astute
design to lead men to cast away the fear of death, and become
more courageous. The Bardic philosophers and moralists
looked further than that. " They taught that this world
was to be of permanent duration, but subject to a succession
of violent revolutions, which would be produced sometimes
by the predominating power of the element of water, and
sometimes by that of fire. The whole animated creation,
they said, originated in the lowest point of existence, evil in  
  
  
  * Smith's Religion of Ancient Britain, p. 37.
<!-- Leaf 19, Page: 5 -->
the extreme; and arrived by a regular train of gradations at
the probationary state of humanity. Those gradations were
necessarily evil, but more or less so as they were removed
from the first source. In the state of humanity, good and
evil were equally balanced; and consequently it was a state
of liberty, in which, if the actions and conduct ofthe agent
preponderated to evil, death gave but an awful passage by
which he returned to animal life, in a condition below
humanity, equal to the degree of turpitude he had debased
himself with in his former state of probation : and if his life
then was desperately wicked, it was possible for him to fall
to his original vileness, or the lowest point of existence, and
a renewal of his former progression through brutal existence
took place; and this was his destiny as often as evil had its
ascendancy in his state of trial. If, on the other hand, good
was predominant in the heart of man, death was deemed a
welcome messenger to conduct him to a more exalted
condition, where he was still progressive; but he was then
removed into a state necessarily good, and therefore beyond
the influence of evil, or the danger of falling.

To relieve the otherwise insupportable tedium of eternity,
he there undergoes the most delightful renovations in endless
succession, without being deprived of the consciousness of
his former conditions. " He may evenr eturn to a state of
second manhood, yet without the possibility of evil having
again the ascendancy; consequently the return of such a
benign soul was considered a blessing to the world."*
Where Bardism prevailed, there was also a belief that the
souls of the dead returned to animate other bodies, after the
lapse of a certain number of years. In the meantime, it
seems to have been thought that they lived with similarly
disembodied spirits in another world. The ancient Britons
gave a cogent proof of this conviction, which, much as modes
of thought have altered since, would find admirers even at
the present day;—they put off the settlement of accounts
and exaction of debts till they should meet in the world to
come,-fAfter the doctrines, the sacred orders of Bardism claim

<!-- Leaf 20, Page: 6 -->
our attention. The sources of information on this interesting
subject are the classical writers, Cæsar, Diodorus, Strabo,
Mela, Pliny the Younger, and Ammianus. These speak a9
intelligent observers, or diligent compilers: a greatly inferior
class, yet, I would fain hope, not without their use.
Independent of their testimony, we have the native ore in the rich
mines of Welsh archaiology. The statements ofthe classical
authorities lelate, without exception, to French Druidism;
but Cæsar, the best guide, writes, " The Druidical system is
thought to have had its origin in Britain, from whence it was
introduced into Gaul; and it is still customary for those who
wish to study it more thoroughly to pass over into Britain for
that purpose."* With this agrees the Institutional Triad:—
\"The three reasons why the Bards are entitled Bards, according
to the rights and institutes ofthe Bards ofthe Isle of Britain :
First, because Bardism originated in Britain; secondly,
because pure Bardism was never well understood in any other
country; thirdly, because pure Bardism can never be
maintained but by means of the Institutes and conventional voice
of the Bards ofthe Isle of Britain."-)- Our scholars and
antiquaries have hence assumed, that in their chief features the
Bardism of Francs and that of England were identical, and
what is said ofthe one may be taken as a correct account of
the other. Cæsar states:—"The Druids act in all sacred
matters, attend to the sacrifices which are offered, either by
the state in general or by private individuals, and answer all
questions concerning their religion. They always have about
them a large number of young men as pupils, who treat them
with the greatest respect. For it is they who decide in all
controversies, whether public or private, and they judge all
causes, whether of murder, of a contested inheritance, or of
the boundaries of estates. They assign both rewards and
punishments; and whoever does not abide by their sentence,
whether he be in a public or private station, is forbidden to be
present at the sacrifices to the gods. This is, in fact, their
most severe mode of punishment; and those who have been
thus excommunicated are held as impious and profane; all
avoid them; no one will either meet them or speak to them,
lest they should receive detriment from their contagion.  
  
  
  » Cæsar, Comment, vi. 13. t Camb. Brit. March 1821.
<!-- Leaf 21, Page: 7 -->
Every species of honour is withheld from them; and if they
are plaintiffs in a court of law, justice is denied them. All
the Druids are subject to one chief, who enjoys the greatest
authority among them. Upon the death of the chief Druid,
the next in dignity is appointed to succeed him; and if there
are two whose merits are equal, the election is made by the
votes of the whole body. But sometimes they dispute for
pre-eminence with the sword. At a certain period of the
year, the Druids assemble in a consecrated grove in the
country of the Carnuti (Chartres), which they consider to be
the centre of Gaul. Here they are met by all who are at
variance with one another, and who come here to have their
quarrels decided." I omit the passage before cited relating
to the British origin of Druidism. " The Druids enjoy
peculiar privileges. They are exempted from service in war, ami
from the payment of taxes. They have also many other
immunities, which cause their order to become numerous and
influential, and young persons are gladly placed with them
to learn their doctrines, by their parents and relations. In
their schools the pupils are said to learn by heart a large
number of verses; and in this way some of their scholars pass
twenty years in completing their education, for it is unlawful
to commit their doctrines to writing. It seems to me that
they have two motives to this conduct; in the first place,
they are unwilling that their tenets should become known to
the vulgar; and, secondly, they are afraid that the pupils will
be less apt to cultivate their memories if they trust to written
characters, which often have the effect of checking diligent
study. Among their most important tenets is the Immortality
ofthe Soul, which they believe passes after death into other
bodies; they hold this to be a great inducement to the
practice of virtue, as the mind becomes relieved from the
fear of death. Their other doctrines concern the motions of
the heavenly bodies, the magnitude of the earth and the
universe, the nature of things, the powers and attributes of
the Immortal Gods."* Diodorus, speaking ofthe Druids, says,
\"Frequently, during hostilities, when armies are approaching
each other, with swords drawn and lances extended, these
men, rushing between them, put an end to their contentions,
taming them as they would tame wild beasts."-j- Strabo  
  
  
  Cæsar, vi. 13, &c. t Diod. Sic. v. 31.
<!-- Leaf 22, Page: 8 -->
writes,—" Among the Gauls three classes are more especially
held in veneration : the Bards, Vates, and Druids. They
consider the soul to be immortal, and also the world, but that
ultimately fire and water will prevail."*


The three orders then were, Bards, Druids, Ovates. The
Bards were poets; and since the inspirations of genius
survive change and revolution, the wreck and extinction of
dynasties, it is as Bardism that their old national faith is dear
to the hearts of Welshmen. The Druids were priests and
judges,—august functions, filling to the eye of the stranger
the whole field of vision; hence the second order gave a name
to the whole three. The Ovates were a mixed class,
replenished from the ranks of the people. The cultivators of
science and art: these occupied no mean position, though,
from the nature of their employments, they drew to
themselves less observation.


To begin at the lowest step: a Bardic student bore a
distinctive title, Awenydd. \ The indispensable
qualifications for a scholar were noble birth and unimpeachable
morals. On matriculation, he bound himself by oath not to
reveal the mysteries into which he was about to be initiated.
He was, however, seldom initiated into anything of
importance, until his understanding, affections, morals, and general
character, had undergone several trials. He was closely
observed when he was least aware of it; there was an eye, to
him invisible, continually fixed upon him; and from the
knowledge thus obtained an estimate was formed of his
principles and abilities. According to the approbation given,
and in the manner and degree thought proper, he was
instructed in the doctrines of Bardism. During his
probationary state of discipline he was to learn such verses and
adages as contained the maxims of the Institution, and to
compose others himself on any relative subject, doctrinal or
moral. An Awenydd wore a plaid dress ofthe Bardic
colours, blue, green, and white. He constantly resided with
his teachers, and was strictly forbidden to converse with any
strangers so long as he continued in the college.

The candidate who had passed the ordeal was notimme

British Church, p. 43.

diately invested with the full privileges of the Bardic order;
he became a preceptor, or inchoate Bard, under the title
Bardd-Caw, and wore, for the first time, the band of the
order. Not till after he had presided at three Gorseddau, or
assemblies, was he fully qualified to exercise all the functions
of the office.* A full Bard could proclaim and hold a Gorsedd,
admit disciples, and Ovyddion, and instruct youth in the
principles of religion and morality. The dress of the Bard was
uni-coloured, of sky-blue — an emblem of peace and truth.
His person was sacred. He might pass in safety through
hostile countries. He never appeared in an army but as
an herald, and under the modern idea of a flag of truce. In
the Institutional Triads are set forth " the three primary
privileges ofthe Bards of the Isle of Britain,—maintenance
wherever they go, that no naked weapon be borne in their
presence, and that their testimony be preferred to that of all
others. The three ultimate objects of Bardism, — to reform
morals and customs, to secure peace, and to praise
everything good and excellent. The three things forbidden to a
Bard, — immorality, satire, and the bearing of arms. The
three delights ofthe Bards ofthe Isle of Britain, — the
prosperity of science, the reformation of manners, and the triumph
of peace over devastation and pillage. The three necessary
but reluctant duties of the Bards of the Isle of Britain,—
secrecy for the sake of peace and the public good, invective
lamentation demanded by justice, and the unsheathing of the
sword against the lawless and the depredatory. Three things
which the Bards ought most to maintain,—the Welsh
language, primitive Bardism, and the remembrance of all that is
good and excellent."f Of the moral and religious
instruction imparted, it will be more proper to speak when we come
to the Druids; but as the Bards were poets by profession,
it is worth while to transcribe from the Triads the canons
which these standard authorities laid down for proficiency
in their art. " The three primary requisites of poetical
genius,—an eye that can see nature, a heart that can feel
nature, and a resolution that dares follow nature. The three
final intentions of poetry,—increase of goodness, increase of

<!-- Leaf 24, Page: 10 -->
understanding, and increase of delight. The three properties
of a just imagination,—what may be, what ought to be, what
is seemly to be. The three indispensables of poetical
language,—purity, copiousness, and ease. Three things that
ought to be well understood in poetry,__the great, the little,
and their correspondence. Three things to be avoided in
poetry,—the mean, the obscure, and the extravagant. Three
things to be chiefly considered in poetical illustration,—what
shall be obviously seen, what shall be instantly admired, and
what shall be eminently characteristic. The three dignities
of poetry,—the true and wonderful united, the union of the
beautiful and the wise, and the union of art and nature. The
three advantages of poetry,—the praise of goodness, the
memory of what is remarkable, and the invigoration of the
affections. The three purities of poetry,—pure truth, pure
language, and pure conception. Three things that poetry
should thoroughly be,—thoroughly learned, thoroughly
animated, thoroughly natural."*

The Druids were the second order, but it was necessary
to pass through the first to reach it. That is to say, a
Druid must have been a Bard, though it was by no means
required that a Bard should be a Druid. The Druids were
priests and judges; this union in their persons of the
sacerdotal and judicial functions gave them great weight and
authority, and caused their office to be much in request.
The Druids do not appear to have had any fixed residences
in parishes or districts, within which settled limits their
ministrations were confined, but to have gone periodical
circuits to instruct the people, and try causes, civil and
criminal. The place of meeting of the Druids was called
Gwyddfa,-j- which as the name implies, a place of presence,
was an eminence either natural or artificial, according to the
conveniency of the situation. Thus in Wales, where there
could be no necessity for raising a mound, the meetings were
held generally on some of the most remarkable hills. As
the Bardic Order was the centre of the system, the Druid
may be considered as the deputy sent among the people from
the Gorsedd of the primitive Bards, for the sake of diffusing
instruction. Therefore the Gwyddfa was a place designed  
  
  
  » Camb. Brit. Nov. 1820.  
  
  
  t Dr. Pugh's Dictionary, at the word " Derwydd."
<!-- Leaf 25, Page: 11 -->
chiefly like a pulpit, to deliver discourses from, and not a
court or place of legislature. The Druids-were the preachers
of their times; several of their sermons are extant. Thev are
short, pithy, and to the purpose; and without intending the
least disrespect to the pulpit oratory at the present day, we
may think ourselves fortunate if, from an average discourse,
we can carry away as much as could be packed into a Welsh
Triad, and leave no spare room. " Three things which
make a man equal to an angel,— the love of every good,
the love of charity, and the love of pleasing God.* Thiee
things that from being despised bring punishment, — the
counsel of a spectator, the judgment of the discreet, and the
complaint of the poor. The three things the removal whereof
is a curse,—the boundary of land, the course of water, and a
direction of a road or path. Three unseemly and unjust
opinions in any person whatsoever,—the thinking himself
wise, the thinking that every person else is unwise, and the
thinking that everything he may like is becoming in him.
The three similitudes of a man to a devil,—in frightening a
child, obstructing the way, and laughing at mischief. There
are three sorts of men,—a man to God, who does good for
evil; a man to man, who does good for good, and evil for
evil; and a man to the devil, who does evil for good. The
three primary qualities of goodness,—to speak the truth in
spite of everything, to love every good, and suffer with
fortitude for all truth and all good." A white robe,
emblematic of truth and holiness, and also of the solar light, was
the distinguishing dress of the Druids.

The fundamental principle of Bardism was equality.f
Each of the orders had a peculiarity of estimation, yet
neither was held to be intrinsically more excellent than the
other. If with respect to qualifications for certain offices one
was deemed inferior, it was in other particulars allowed to
be superior; so that, considered on the whole, they were
equally honourable. The dignity, however, of Arch-Druid
did not quite square with this equality, though this
infusion of the monarchical element proved in after ages a main
stay to the system, on the constitutional principles of which
the delegation of supreme authority appeared to innovate.

<!-- Leaf 26, Page: 12 -->
The Arch-Druid was the head of religion, and chief-justiciary
of the kingdom. »He is supposed to have resided, at one
period at all events, in the Isle of Anglesey, in or near what
is now the parish of Llanidan, in which is preserved the
name Tre'r Dryw, or Druid's - town, and which abounds
with remains of those simple but massive structures in or
around which the ancient Britons worshipped the God of
their fathers. Drewson, or Druid's-town, in
Pembrokeshire, is also mentioned as a place at which the
ArchDruids held their courts. With regard to the ruins at the
last-named place, Mr. Fenton, in his valuable " History
of Pembrokeshire," writes:—" On the road leading from
Fishguard to Dale there occurs a remarkable inclosure,
occupying nearly an acre of ground, called Drewson Chapel.
The stones that composed the Druidical circle were removed
in 1740 to build with, so that there is scarcely anything left
to mark the situation of this spacious Gorsedd, or place of
convention for various purposes." * A similar explanation
will, I fear, account for the disappearance of a great many
more.


The maxims of law and equity laid down by the Druid
judges would not disgrace Westminster Hall. The following
Triads are from the laws of Dyvnwal Moelmud, a celebrated
Cymric prince and legislator, who flourished about 440 B.C.:
—" The three privileges and protections ofa social state,—
security of life and person, security of possession and
dwelling, security of national right. Three things that confirm
the social state,—effectual security of property, just
punishment where it is due, and mercy tempering justice where the
occasion requires it in equity. The three elements of law
are knowledge, national right, and conscientiousness. The
three ornaments of a social state,—the learned scholar, the
ingenious artist, and the just judge. The three proofs of a
judge,—knowledge of the law, knowledge of the customs
which the law does not supersede, and knowledge of its
times, and the business thereto belonging. Three things
which a judge ought always to study,—equity habitually,
mercy conscientiously, and knowledge profoundly and
accurately.f

The judicial habit of the Arch-Druid was splendid and
imposing.* He was clothed in a stole of -virgin white, over
a closer robe of the same, fastened by a girdle, on which
appeared the crystal of augury encased in gold. Round his
neck was the breastplate of judgment, said to possess the
salutary but uncomfortable property of squeezing the neck ou
the utterance of a corrupt judgment. Below the breastplate
was suspended the Glain Neidr, or serpent's jewel. On his
head he had a tiara of gold. On each of two fingers of his
right-hand he wore a ring; one plain, the other the
chainring of divination. As he stood beside the stone altar his
hand rested on the Elucidator, which consisted of several
staves called Coelbrenau, omen sticks, on which the judicial
maxims were cut; and which being put into a frame, were
turned at pleasure, so that each stave represented a triplet
when formed of three ' sides.' The reader will be so good
as to admire the official costume of the Arch-Druid, and
wait a few pages for the explanation.


The third order was the Ovydd, or Ovate, to wliich the
candidate could be immediately admitted without being
obliged to pass through the regular discipline. The requisite
qualifications were, in general, an acquaintance with
discoveries in science, the use of letters, medicine, language, and
the like. On particular occasions, in consideration of other
eminent gifts, even the knowledge of, and a genius for poetry,
might be dispensed with. The Ovydd was, however, enjoined
to acquaint himself with the Bardic Institutes and traditions.
For it might occur that the order of Ovates should alone
continue, which in its original purity could not be done,
unless they were acquainted with its true principles, nature,
and intention. The Ovydd could exercise all the functions
of Bardism; and by some particular performance he became
entitled to other degrees, on the confirmation of a Gorsedd.
The candidate for the order of Ovydd was elected at a
Gorsedd, on the previous recommendation of a graduated
Bard of any of the three orders, who might from his own
knowledge declare that he whom he proposed was duly
qualified. If the candidate were not known to a Bard, the
recommendation of a judge or magistrate, or twelve reputable  
  
  
  » Meyrick's Costumes, p. 28.
<!-- Leaf 28, Page: 14 -->
men, could constitute him a candidate; on which he was
immediately elected by ballot. The dress of the Ovydd was
green, the symbol of learning, as being the colour of the
clothing of nature; and it was unmixed with any other, to
show that it was uniform like truth.* It is rather difficult to
light on a Triad peculiarly appropriate to an Ovydd; I will
cite a few that breathe a philosophical spirit:—" The three
demonstrations of the usefulness of knowledge,—wisdom,
piety, and tranquillity. Three things that produce
correctness,—bodily power, expertness of art, and a willing genius.
The three primary teachers of man,—a genius loving exertion,
considerate reason, and a moral conscience. Three men upon
whom all ought to look with affection,—he who looks with
affection on the face of the earth, he who is delighted with
rational works of art, and he who looks lovingly on little
children.t The three branches of the duty of man,—devotion
towards God, benevolence to his fellow-creatures, and the
improvement of the sciences." J The Triads relating to
language ma3' with more certainty be ascribed to the Ovates.
\"The three correct qualities of a language,—correct
construction, correct etymology, and correct pronunciation. The
three supports of language,—order, strength, and synonymy.
The three things that constitute just description,—just selection
of words, just construction of language, and just comparison.
The three best things appertaining to just selection,—the best
language, the best order, and the best object."§ I may just
mention another Triad, which tends to confirm the impression
that, in those bright and beautiful days, science and literature
not only carried away brilliant honours, but also received
substantial rewards,—that solid beef and pudding, ay, and
sparkling mead, which digest so well, and give to praise so
agreeable a relish. A philosopher, unless he had something
to lose, would not have dictated the following axiom, worthy
ofthe sagacity ofa modern detective.|| "The three
indications of a thief,—an inquisitive tongue, a prying eye, and a
timid avoiding countenance; that is, the three united in one

person.

The wear and tear of from twenty to thirty centuries, and
the decays of memory, have thinned off the great names of art
and science, so that not above half-a-dozen survive. If this
remnant seem marvellously small, guess what would be our
residuum after a similar interval. The three great works of
the Isle of Britain would then possibly stand thus : " The
Tubular Bridge at Menai, the Thames Tunnel, and the
Crystal Palace." The few rescued Ovates were men of
science. " The three distinguished astronomers of the Isle
of Britain,—Idris the Giant, Gwdion the son of Don,
and Gwyn ap Nudd; and by the extent of their knowledge
concerning the stars, their natures, and their qualities, they
could prognosticate whatever was wished to be known unto
the day of doom." The last two are considered to have
lived after the Christian era; the first, long before. The giant
Idris, we are told, studied the heavenly bodies from the top
of one of the loftiest mountains in North Wales; which, in
consequence, received the name whieh it still bears, Cader
Idris, the Chair of Idris. On the very summit there is said
to be an excavation in the solid rock, resembling a couch,
on which whoever rests a night will be found in the morning
either dead, raving mad, or inspired. Idris had notions of
comfort, or may have experienced what sad inroads petty
annoyances make on sublime speculations; so, like a true
philosopher as he was, before he ascended to his chair he
shook three grains of sand out of his shoe, and there they
are now, as large as life,—possibly a little larger, as each would
do duty fora respectable mountain out of Wales. " The three
beneficent artisans of the Isle of Britain,—Corvinwrthe Bard
of Ceri, of the long white Lake, who first made a ship with
sail and rudder for the nation of the Cymry; Morddal, the
man of the torrent, the artisan of Ceraint ab Greidiawl, who
first taught the work of stone and lime to the nation of the
Cymry, in the time that the Emperor Alexander was bringing
the world under him; and Coel ap Cyllin ap Caradawg ap
Bran, who first made a mill of sound and wheel for the
nation of the Cymry: and they were three Bards."* The
last is supposed to have been the grandson of Caractacus.

There was also another order, which my fair readers, if any  
  
  
  * Cam. Brit. May 1821,
<!-- Leaf 30, Page: 16 -->
venture on this little essay, will think me exceedingly
ungallant to have placed where I have; but this comes of
compiling : however, I have the satisfaction of laying the blame
on the authorities whom I have followed. There were
Druidesses, as well as Druids, divided, it is said, into three
classes. The first class never married, but lived together
conventually, in complete retirement from the world. To
the second class marriage was permitted, though they must
have made but indifferent wives, as they were continually at
their prayers and religious services, and scarcely ever at
home. The third class were a kind of lay-sisters, answering
to our Protestant church-cleaners and pew-openers, who did
all the hard work a woman could do, in the care of the
temples and preparation for the rites to be performed in
them. I have exhausted my pages, not my subject, on
which a great deal more might be said.

The rites and ceremonies of Bardism, the third branch of
inquiry, complete our Triad. The principle of the Bardic
Institute, confining instruction to oral teaching, and throwing
all upon the memory, rendered it necessary, in addition to the
ordinary collegiate course, to hold general meetings, at
which the scholars might contend in trials of skill, and thus
a powerful stimulus to exertion be given. At these general
assemblies degrees were conferred, and the business of the
Institute transacted. Courts of judicature were also held,
and the whole was crowned by a grand religious festival.
The Bardic was a lunar year, the months of which were
computed to run from the sixth day of one moon to the same day of
the next. The reason was, because on the sixth day the moon
became distinctly visible. There was also another
consideration, which had weight. The affairs of this lower world being
supposed to be very much subject to planetary influences, at
six days the moon was sedate and matronly, and fit to
govern, instead of a giddy young thing, as she must have
been only a few hours old. The four principal conventions
were held near the summer and winter solstices and the
equinoxes. Subordinate meetings might also take place at every
<!-- Leaf 32, Page: 18 -->
new and full moon, and likewise at the quarter-days, which
were chiefly for instructing disciples.*

The spot selected as the scene of this great solemnity must
have possessed certain natural qualifications—a rising ground
embosomed in a grove of trees, with a running stream, lake,
or fountain near. Our puny strength, with all modern
appliances, would be long in erecting a Druid temple; but it
is not quite so hard to build one an paper. Let us try.
First, a large space in the centre ofa solemn grove of ancient
overhanging oaks is to be cleared, in the form of a circle or
oval; then huge, unhewn stone pillars, 'must be set up at
certain intervals round the outer rim ofthe circle; the earth
dislodged may serve for a rampart: upon the tops of the
pillars we will lay large blocks of stone horizontal, connecting
one with the other. Within our circle there shall be, towards
the east, a similar smaller circle, which we will call, under
learned Mr. Rowland's direction, the cirque or place of
judicature.t In the centre of our great circle we will have a
triangular slab, resting on two or more supporters, which,
without fear of the Court of Arches, we will call a stone altar,
or cromlech; in Bardic language, the Stone of the Covenant.
Scattered about on the west side there shall be a number of
smaller stones in circles, or circularwise, which we will name
places of worship for private or secret prayer, or for the
offering of lesser oblations. Science, in ages boasting of
civilization, has often had cause to complain of coldness and
neglect; the Bards paid even more than a just homage, they
actually worshipped it. The great circle of their temples
symbolized the circle of the zodiac. The lesser circles, consisting
of twelve, nineteen, thirty, or sixty stones, represented certain
cycles and computations deduced from the study of astronomy.
And " than the cromlech," as has been acutely remarked by
an accomplished contributor to that valuable periodical, the
"Archæologia Cambrensis," "there cannot be a form
better suited to embody the idea of that balancing and
selfadjusting power which is found to control all the celestial
motions, and to pervade the whole of the solar system."!

There are in different parts ofthe principality several Druidic
remains resembling the above description, as nearly as the
industrial energies of the farmer, quarry-man, and
stonemason, for generations past, will allow. In describing Eastern
Churches I did not ask my readers to go and examine
venerable structures thousands of miles off, and now, were I
to suggest the study of the Druidic temples in Wales, I fear
lest, from a different cause, I should fall into a like
impertinence; for who is there with any feeling for the grandeur of
nature who has not already trod, with light and joyous step,
the heather-clad mountains and sweet vales of Cambria?
However, as a special object may impart a new interest, I
will point out a few spots which will repay a visit. In
Anglesey, Llanidan and its adjoining townships;
DwyGyvylchi, in Snowdonia; Llanbadarn, Cardiganshire, the
stones here are in the burial-ground of a chapel of ease at
Yspytty. In Clynnog, Carnarvonshire, is or was — as the
pickaxe keeps pace with the pen, all references must be
understood with this qualification — an uncommonly large
cromlech in a field near the sea, belonging to a tenement
called Bachwen. The inclination of the table-stone dips
towards the west, and contains on its surface several shallow
holes, some larger than others, supposed to have been made
for the purposes of augury.* The sea-coast of
Pembrokeshire abounds in vestiges of Druidism; they are to be met
with particularly in the neighbourhood of Fishguard,
Abercastle, and in the district of Cernaes.


The Gorsedd, or great convention, was, by a rule that
admitted of no exception, held in a conspicuous place, in full
view and hearing of country and aristocracy, and in the (ace
of the sun, and in the eye of light; it being unlawful to hold
such meetings either under cover at night, or under any
circumstances otherwise than while the sun shall be visible in
the sky. The Ovates, who were looked upon as a kind of
honorary members, might and did hold meetings in private.
At every Gorsedd of tlie Chair of assembly were published
the instructions of the Bards of the Isle of Britain—that is to
say, the records of the knowledge and sciences, and of the
arrangements, and rules, and privileges, and customs of the  
  
  
  * Evans's N. Wales, p. 374.
<!-- Leaf 34, Page: 20 -->
Bards. Then the exhibitions were called for. Any Bard
who had anything which he wished to exhibit, exhibited it to
the chair, whether poetry, genealogical rolls, or record of
honourable achievement, or improvement in knowledge and
science. After the exhibitors, hearing was given to such
claims and appeals as were brought forward; and after that
dialogues and chair-disputations concerning poetry and its
appurtenances; and afterwards they proceeded to hold a
council of judgment upon the merits of what had been brought
before the chair and the Gorsedd; and then publication was
made of the decision and the judgment, and the presents
were made.* The ceremony observed at the opening of a
convention was the sheathing ofa sword on the central stone,
at which all the presiding Bards assisted, accompanied by a
short and pithy address, beginning and ending with the
Bardic motto, " Truth against the world." The meeting was
closed by taking up but not unsheathing the sword, with a
few appropriate words. The Bards at these conventions
always appeared bare-footed and bare-headed, in their
unicoloured robes. Isa Bard had been convicted of any crime,
he was publicly degraded, and could never after be
readmitted. On these painful occasions, which were very rare,
the convention closed by the Bards covering their heads, and
one of them unsheathed the sword, held it on high, and
having named the guilty person aloud three times, proclaimed,
\"The sword is naked against him."f

At the same periods, to suit the public convenience, courts
of judicature were held. The Arch-Druid presided; his
jurisdiction was very extensive: indeed it would be harder to
tell what it did not, than what it did embrace. Cæsar writes,
\"In almost all controversies, whether public or private, the
decision is left to them; and if any crime is committed,
any murder perpetrated, if any dispute arise touching an
inheritance, or the limit of an adjoining estate, in all such
cases they are the supreme judges." To qualify the Druids
for this last duty, surveying and land-measuring formed a
regular branch of their education. The Arch-Druid, when
presiding in his court, wore the robes already described. The  
  
  
  * Arch. Camb. Jan. 1850.  
  
  
  t Williams's Cymry, p. 16.
<!-- Leaf 35, Page: 21 -->
colour was white, expressive of purity in the administration
of law and justice; he had on the girdle or band, the badge of
his order, and upon this girdle was the crystal of augury
encased in gold. Augury, under which term is included
divination generally — that answers to hypothesis and conjecture,
which so largely enter into modern decisions, and justify the
maxim ofthe glorious uncertainties of the law—was in high
repute with the Druids. Observe its operation in civil suits :
instead of a cause creeping at a snail's pace through all
the courts up to the Court of Appeal, and being decided at
length when there is nothing left to fight about, some
halfcentury from the ill-omened day that the first litigant wrote
his letter of instructions to the great-grandfather of the
solicitor who conducts the suit,—instead of this exhaustive
process, if a knotty point arose in the court of the
ArchDruid it was decided on the spot, by the inspection of the
entrails of a slain animator by the flight of birds, their notes
whether plaintive or cheerful, or by tallies and numbers, or
by the motions of the serpent, a beautiful specimen of which
lay in a delightful berth at the foot of the altar of augury,
and lived as a snake in office should, on clover. So far from
thinking scorn of Druid jurisprudence, we must acknowledge
that they had greatly the advantage of ourselves, who are left
quite as much to guess-work as they were, without the
compensation of witnessing an interesting and impressive ceremony.
In criminal causes, on which life depended, the popular
opinion of the virtue supposed to reside in these rites of
divination may have often given to them a real efficacy; and
conscience, that makes cowards of us all, may have revealed
its dreadful secret in the heaving bosom. The crystal of
augury on the girdle of the Arch-Druid was no unimportant
accessory. As this jewel sparkled or grew dim, the plaintiff
or defendant, prosecutor or prisoner, shook in their shoes.
The property of the breastplate of judgment has been noticed
already. Say what we will ofthe law's delays, it is a comfort
to know that each and every of our judges might wear
such a reminder all their lives, and not the minutest
examination discover so much as a mark on their necks. Below the
breastplate of judgment hung the Glain Neidr, adder's stone,
or adder's egg. It is uncertain whether this famous amulet
was a natural or artificial production. On the former
<!-- Leaf 36, Page: 22 -->
supposition the following account is given—wonderful if true—
that about Midsummer the snakes congregate, when joining
their heads together, and giving a simultaneous hiss, a kind
of bubble is formed on the head of one of them; on which his
opposite neighbour having drawn along breath, gives a loud
hiss, and the bubble, not choosing to stay to be insulted in
this manner, runs along the serpent's back till it comes off at
the tail, and then, like a sensible bubble, does not burst, but
keeps its shape and consistency, and when it has become hard
by exposure to the weather resembles a glass ring; and
whosoever finds it will prosper in all his future undertakings:
a result clearly showing no affinity to exist between these and
our modern bubbles. The supposition that the Glain Neidr
was an artificial product is much more probable and prosaic.
The manufacture was a secret which died with the Druids.
These stones were coloured, some white, some blue, some
green,and others white, blue, and green mixed. The Bards wore
the blue; the Druids, the white; the Ovates, the green; the
scholars wore the tri-coloured stones. The ornament was
symbolical. The serpent, which annually casts his skin, and
seems to return to a second youth, was regarded by the Druids
as a symbol of renovation, the renovation of mankind being
the great doctrine set forth by the Bardic mysteries.* About
the chain-ring of divination worn by the Arch-Druid on his
right hand, I can say nothing; Dr. Meyrick, my authority,
gives it an Irish name, Iogh-Draoch. The Arch-Druid
enforced obedience to his decisions by very stringent penalties.
"Whosoever," writes Cæsar, "does not abide by the sentence,
whether he be in a public or private station, is forbidden to
be present at the sacrifices to the gods. This is, in fact, their
most severe mode of punishment, and those who have been
thus excommunicated are held as impious and profane; all
avoid them; no one will either meet or speak to them, lest
they should receive detriment from their contagion; every
species of honour is withheld from them; and if they are
plaintiffs in a court of law, justice is denied them." Few
would have the hardihood to incur this punishment, worse
than that awarded to the original offence. Whatever may be
thought of these defensive severities, designed for thepro* Davies' Mythology, p. 210.

tection of society, for social order cannot be preserved when
the tribunals of justice have ceased to be respected, the
prominence given to them proves these courts not to have
been sanguinary: excommunication is for the living, it has no
terrors for the dead.


Our present tone of feeling on the subject of capital
punishment leads us to aim at two ends: first, that public
executions be as few, and, secondly, that they be as impressive
as possible. Towards the first object we have made
considerable advances; towards the second, it cannot be said that
our progress has been equally satisfactory. If there be one
sight more sad and sickening than another, it is not a
malefactor on the scaffold, but the crowd beneath it. The Bardic
system breathed nothing but " peace on earth and good-will
towards men." Nor, calmly and fairly considered, did the
dealing with human life manifest that frightful inconsistency
which we, following our classical instructors, have been too
ready to ascribe to it. The Druids had in view the same
objects as ourselves, the only difference being that they were
more successful in their attainment. To surround the
forfeiture of life to outraged justice with salutary terrors, they
made the execution a religious act; the victim bled on the
altar, not the criminal on the scaffold. The circumstances
attending the infliction ofthe fatal stroke have been commented
on as the refinement of barbarity. The author ofthe "
Religion of Ancient Britain,"* after speaking of the examination
of the entrails of animals, proceeds,—"To this ordinary
practice they are said to have added another, peculiarly horrid.
On great occasions," copying from Diodorus Siculus,
\"they practise a very strange and incredible manner of
divination. They take a man who is to be sacrificed and
kill him with one stroke ofthe sword above the diaphragm,
and by observing the posture in which he falls, his different
convulsions, and the direction in which the blood flows from
his body, they (orm tlieir predictions, according to certain
rules which have been left them by their ancestors." The
extinction of life, it may be observed, was instantaneous.
Now, to say nothing of the rack and the wheel, cruel
mutilations and slow fires, there have been occasions on wliich the

hangman and headsman have been less skilful or more
unfortunate. What followed, the posture in which the corpse
fell, the quivering ofthe limbs, the direction in which the
blood flowed,—these phenomena were made subservient to the
science of divination, just as for the advancement of the
science of medicine the bodies of the executed were, till
very lately, directed to be delivered to the surgeons for
dissection. It is asserted that the innocent suffered
sometimes; the fact may have been so, I shall not dispute it. But
in other countries, accounted highly civilised, have the
innocent never suffered ? Has the ordinary and equitable course
of justice never been turned aside by the will of tyrants or
the madness of the people ? Or, where neither of these
causes has operated, where the law has been carefully and
conscientiously administered, have the innocent never suffered,
through circumstantial evidence, fitting to the hair, but too
late proved to have been fallacious ? In the life that now is,
the innocent must often suffer. The Gospel reveals a future
judgment, when the errors and injuries, be they what they
may, of earthly tribunals, will be corrected and compensated.

We have viewed in succession the Bardic Convention and

High Court of Judicature; there remains to notice the crowning
event, the religious festival. The Deluge—the great historical
fact of the Triads,—which swept away a corrupted race, was
regarded as a lustration; and since the immediate cause,
according to the Bards, was the bursting of a lake, with the lakes of
Wales, which, reflecting the dark shadows of the mountains that
overhang them, affect the traveller so sweetly and solemnly,
were associated awe-inspiring recollections. Connected with
Llyn Savaddan (Llangorse Pool), in Brecknockshire, runs a
legend which an old man in the town of Hay repeated to Mr.
Davies, and I hope the reader will forgive my prolixity if I
insert it. " The site ofthe present lake was formerly occupied
by a large city, but the inhabitants were reported to be very
wicked. The king of the country sent his servant to examine
into the truth of this rumour, adding a threat, that in case it
should prove to be well founded he would destroy the place,
as an example to his other subjects. The minister arrived
at the town in the evening. All the inhabitants were engaged
in riotous festivity, and wallowing in excess. Not one of
them regarded the stranger, or offered him the rites of
<!-- Leaf 39, Page: 25 -->
hospitality. At last he saw the door open of a mean
habitation, into which he entered; the family had deserted it to
repair to the scene of tumult, all but one infant, who lay
weeping in the cradle. The royal favorite sat down by the
side of this cradle, soothed the little innocent, and was grieved
at the thought that he must perish in the general destruction.
In this situation the stranger passed the night, and whilst he
was diverting the child, he accidentally dropped his glove
into the cradle. The next morning he departed before it was
light, to carry his melancholy tidings to the king; he had
but just left the town when he heard a noise behind him like
a tremendous peal of thunder, mixed with dismal shrieks and
lamentations. He stopped to listen. Now it sounded like
the dashing of waves; and presently all was dead silence.
He could not see what had happened, as it was still dark, and
he felt no inclination to return into the city; so he pursued
his journey till sunrise. The morning was cold. He searched
for his gloves, and finding but one of them, he presently
recollected where he had left the other. The gloves had
been a present from his sovereign. He determined to return
for that which he had left behind. When he was come near
to the site of the town, he observed with surprise that none
of the buildings presented themselves to his view, as on the
preceding day. He proceeded a few steps; the whole
plain was covered with a lake. Whilst he was gazing at this
novel and terrific scene, he remarked a little speck in the
middle of the water; the wind gently wasted it towards the
bank where he stood. As it drew near, he recognised
the identical cradle in wliich he had left his glove. His
joy on recovering this pledge of royal favour, was only
heightened by the assurance that the little object of his
compassion had reached the shore alive and unhurt. He
carried the infant to the king, and told his majesty that
this was all he had been able to save out of that wretched
place."*


The renewal of the face of the earth after the subsidence
of the waters of the deluge was regarded as symbolical of
that moral renovation and progress towards a higher and
purer condition, which were the prevailing ideas ofthe Bardic

  C
<!-- Leaf 40, Page: 26 -->
theology. The public processions were designed to keep the
events ofthe flood in mind. The Patriarch Noah, under his
Bardic title, Hu the Mighty, had his sanctuary in an island.
The isle of Bardsey has been named as the " residence ofthe
Supreme Proprietor;" but its distance—nearly three leagues
from the mainland — and the dangerous current between, are
unfavourable to the conjecture. The ancient name was
Ynys-Enlli, the Island in the Current. The Saxons, because
in their days the Bards fled thither for refuge, called it Bardsey.
The shrine, called Ked, the Ark, rested in its temple within
the sacred island. Here the divinity was supposed to reside,
excepting at the time ofthe solemn processions. The festive
rites lasted a week, and are thus described by Aneurim :—
\"In the festival on the Eve of May (a grand occasion), they
celebrate the praise of the Holy Ones, in the presence of the
purifying fire which was made to ascend on high. On
Tuesday they wear their dark garments (in allusion to the
darkness of the ark during the Patriarch's confinement). On
Wednesday they purified their fair attire (signifying Noah's
restoration to light). On the Thursday they truly performed
their due rites. On the Friday the victims were conducted
round the circle. On the Saturday their united exertions
were displayed without the circular dome. On the Sunday
the men with red blades were conducted round the circle;
and on the Monday the banquet was served."* There are
a great many allusions here which, having no Bard at my
elbow, I cannot understand; but the last pithy record is
intelligible to the meanest capacit\'. I should like to have been
present, and seen it all: should not you, reader? Well,
who knows ? perhaps we were there, in other bodies than
those which we now animate. The ark, it is probable, was
shaped so as to bear some kind of resemblance to a beaver.
This animal was regarded as a symbol ofthe Patriarch. " The
Patriarch had built himself a vessel, or house, in which he
had lived in the midst of the waters, and which had deposited
that venerable personage and his family safe upon dry ground.
So the beaver is said to build a house of two stories, one of
which is in the water, and the other above the water, and
out of the latter he has an egress to dry ground. The  
  
  
  * Meyrick's Costumes, p. 32.
<!-- Leaf 41, Page: 27 -->
fanciful genius of heathenism could not have demanded
or discovered a more happy coincidence with the history in
the diluvian patriarch."* The beaver is not to be found of
Wales at present; and some have affirmed that it never was
there, but the otter only. However, local names support the
tradition; as Nant Francon, the Valley ofthe Beaver, in
Caernarvonshire. The f black beaver was the final cause ofthe
deluge. He it was who pierced the dyke which supported
the Great Lake; and having performed this mischievous feat,
he went down to the bottom ofthe abyss, whence, after the
deluge, lest he should do the like again, he was fished up by
the superhuman efforts of Hu the Mighty, seconded by his
famous oxen the Ychain Banawg. Poor animals ! the}'
deserved a better fate. One of them, in drawing forth the
Afanc, overstrained himself, so that his eyes started out of
their sockets, and he dropped down dead when his task was
over. The other, pining for his companion, refused food,
and wandered about disconsolate, till, worn out at last, he
died at a place called Llan Dewi Brevi, or St. David's the
Lowing,;); in Cardiganshire, so named from the dismal
moanings of the sacred ox. The villagers formerly exhibited as a
relic a large horn, said to have belonged to one of Hu's
oxen; and I dare say, were any of my readers to go and ask
to see it—which I hope they will—the horn would be shown
again, ln this Druidic fable the Afanc seems to be
ultimatelyreferable to the Patriarch himself, or to the ark considered as
his shrine, and supposed to have been extricated from the
waters of the deluge by the sacred oxen. The drawing the
Afanc from the lake was the most popular of the symbolical
rites of Bardism. On the morning after May Eve, when the
song of the cuckoo convened the appointed dance on the
green, the gorgeous ceremonies commenced. The sacred
oxen, hunched, of the best breed, distinguished either by the
size of their horns or some peculiar mark, were stationed
before the lake, whence they drew the shrine from the holy
island, through the shallow water, to the dry ground. As
the oxen drew the shrine, the choir sung a piece of music,
still known to a few persons in Wales, and called Cainc y

Ychain Banawg, imitating the lowing of oxen and the rattling
of chains. The procession then advanced in the following
order : first appeared the divining Bard, bearing his magic
wand; then one hundred and fifty Bards, striking their tuneful
harps; next came the shrine of Ceridwen, the deified spouse
of the Patriarch, borne aloft by attendant priests. The shrine,
a boat or ark, was immediately preceded by three priests —
the hierophant, who represented the Great Creator; one
bearing a torch, who represented the sun; and the herald,
who, as the especial minister of the goddess, was regarded as
a symbol of the moon. A company dancing, after their
manner, in circles, and singing in cadence, some with
garlands of ivy on their brows, others with cornute caps,
announced the Afanc, or car of the diluvian god. A mixed
multitude of dancers and singers, some blowing on crooked
horns, others carrying double pateras, others with crooked
swords, which they clashed against their shields, performing,
as a Bard writes, "the circular revolutions in graceful
extravagance," closed the procession,* which, entering the great
temple, took up their respective places within it. On the
rampart of earth surrounding the temple were crowded the
representatives of the people, the heads of tribes and families,
with their standard-bearers; the rest, in groups on the plain,
watched the procession as it wound along, with the intense
interest always evinced on public occasions. I wish that we
had religious spectacles oftener.

The initiatory rites of Bardism must have proved rather
trying to the novices. The master of the novices was styled
Gwyddnaw, the Priest of the Ship. His office was to
conduct the Bardic candidates through a scenic
representation of the Patriarch's trials. The spot chosen is supposed to
have been Sarn Badrig, or Patrick's Causeway, a dangerous
shoal on the coast of Caernarvonshire, thus described by
Mr. Pennant:—" From some of the adjacent heights I had
a full view, it being low water, of the long range of sand and
gravel which runs from this coast twenty-two miles into the
sea. It is deservedly called Sarn Badrig, or more properly
Badrhwyg, Ship-breaking Causeway, from the number of
vessels lost upon it. This shoal is dry at the ebb ofspring* Meyrick'*? Costumes, p. 34.
<!-- Leaf 43, Page: 29 -->
tides, and marked in storms by horrible breakers."* From
a certain point ofthe mainland, in a certain state of the tide,
the candidate embarked in a coracle, a boat made of osier
twigs covered with hide, and still in use on the rivers of
Wales. In this frail craft the neophyte made his passage to
and from Sarn Badrig. The voyage thither and back, in
which it was a singular good fortune if he had not to swim
for his life, completed his probation. In a poem by Taliesin
allusion is made to this curious and unpleasant ordeal. The
probationer, standing on the shore, and about to enter the
mystic coracle, observing the waves rough, and the rock at
a distance, exclaims, " Though I love the sea-beach, I dread
the open sea." I confess to the same infirmity. " A billow
may come undulating over the stone." To this the hierophant
replies: " To the brave, to the magnanimous, to the amiable,
to the generous, who boldly embarks, the landing-place of
the Bards will prove the harbour of life."f

A certain sacredness, as has been observed, was ascribed
to lakes and streams. The river Dee was the subject of
peculiar sanctity. Rising from two springs near a
farmhouse called Pant Gwn, in Merionethshire, and passing
through the lake Bala, without, it is said, mixing its waters,
the Dee, beyond Chester, loses itself in the Irish Sea. Mr.
Pennant considers that this famed river derives its name, not
from ddu (black), or dwy (two), but from duw (divine).J
Spenser has it among the attendant rivers on the marriage
of the Thames and Medway,—  
  
  
  " And following Dee, which Britons long ygone

Did call divine, that doth by Chester tend."


Milton, also, in Lycidas, writes, " Nor yet where Deva
spreads her wizard stream." The Bards had many striking
usages.


The grove of oak was sacred : a divinity hedged in the
monarch of the forest. The principal tree received an
especial consecration. The Druids, with the general consent of
the whole order, and all the neighbourhood, fixed upon the
most beautiful tree, cut off all its side branches, and then  
  
  
  * Tour in North Wales, vol. ii. p. 274.

<!-- Leaf 44, Page: 30 -->
joined two of them to the higher side of the trunk, so as to
form with it the figure of a cross. Above and below the
insertion of these branches, they cut in the bark of the tree
the word Thau (God). Under this tree they performed
their most sacred rites.* In several plants precious virtues
were supposed to reside: the mistletoe was had in signal
honour. From the scarcity of this parasite,f some botanists
have conjectured the Loranthus Europæus, which grows
freely on the oak, to have been used by the Druids. It is
true that this plant is not to be met with further westward
than the garden of Schoenbrunn, near Vienna; but—when was
science at a loss for an hypothesis ?—this difficulty is bridged
by a really very possible surmise, that when the Bardic
worship was put down, or meant to have been so, the
Loranthus was extirpated from all those parts of Europe where the
Druids were known. However, the scarcity ofthe mistletoe
does not weaken its claim to ancient reverence, and I bow to
its prescriptive dignity. The blossoms ofthe mistletoe appear
within a few days of the summer solstice; the berries, within
a few days of the winter solstice. These indications marked
the return of two of the usual seasons for holding Bardic
conventions. When the sacred rites were finished, the
Ovydd, who might be a physician, took away the berries for
medicinal purposes. The mistletoe was in esteem as a
specific against sterility so late as the beginning ofthe eighteenth
century. In the seventeenth century Lord Bacon writes,—
\"Misletoe groweth chiefly on crab-trees, apple-trees, and
sometimes upon hazels, and rarely upon oaks, the misletoe
whereof is counted very medicinal. It is evergreen, winter
and summer, and beareth a white, glistering berry; and it
is a plant utterly differing from the plant on which it
groweth."! Shorn of its old sanctity, the mistletoe still
keeps its place of honour in our Christmas festivities; and
in the " love passages," on which it approvingly looks down,
remembers its prolific virtues.

With scarcely less observance was the selago, or
hedgehyssop, regarded. With great care and reverence did the

Notes and Queries.

<!-- Leaf 45, Page: 31 -->
Druids gather the selago. Nothing of iron was to cut or
touch it. Nor was the bare hand thought worthy, but a
peculiar vesture applied by means of the right hand. The
vesture must have been holy, and taken off from some sacred
person privately, and with the left hand only. The gatherer
was required to be clothed in white, his feet naked, and
washed in pure water. He was first to offer a sacrifice of
bread and wine before he proceeded to gather the selago,
which was carried from the place of its nativity in a clean
white napkin, and preserved by the Druids as a charm against
all misfortunes.* The Druids, we are told, were also
excessively fond of the vervain. They used it in casting lots
and foretelling events, also as a love-philter. It was to be
gathered at the rise of the dog-star, without having been
looked upon either by the sun or the moon,—in order to
which the earth was to be propitiated by a libation of honey.
In digging it up, the left hand was to be used. It was then
to be waved aloft, and the leaves, stalk, and roots were to be
dried separately in the shade. The couches at feasts were
sprinkled with water in which the vervain had been iufused.f
There was also another plant, or rather tree, associated with
joy and gladness, which has suffered a melancholy mutation
—stern discipline has much to answer for in the destruction
of so much beautiful sentiment — the birch-tree. The
Maypole was always made of birch : the birch—to think that.

or complacency in doing a kind act. When a maiden

On the eves of certain days—as, in our mode of speaking,
the eves of May-day, St. John the Baptist, All-Saints'—fires
were lighted on the tops of the hills, and near every house,
accompanied by various ceremonies." Now, to go without
our annual bonfire is a thing not to be dreamt of; still, how
much better would it be to have it on All-Saints' eve, in a
spirit of love and ancestral piety, than on the fifth of
November, in a spirit of strife and bitterness. The thirty-first of
October was the great celebration : men, women, and children

ran through the fire and the smoke, each casting a stone into
the fire, and all running off at the conclusion to escape from
the goblin black-tailed sow. Various rustic sports followed :
here might have been seen a merry group catching with the
mouth only at a fine, round, smooth apple, suspended by a
string; there as many heads bobbing up and down at a tub
of water, on the surface of which floated, or at the bottom
of which lay hid, many an attractive prize : then every one
present threw a nut into the fire; those which burnt bright
betokened prosperity to the owners through the following
year, those that burnt black and cracked denoted misfortune.
On the next morning, search was made for the stones; if
any were missing, this betided ill to those who threw them
in.* On the present observances, or rather those of thirty
or forty years ago, a correspondent in the " Cambro-Briton "
writes, — "The evening of this day is spent in mirth and
gladness. Bonfires are kindled; labour is suspended; the
villagers assemble; and the young and active dance to thc
music of the harp, or pass their time in athletic and rural
games. I well remember with what eager joy I was wont,
during my boyish days, to hail the approach of this festival.
I always spent it at the rector's." That is right: the good
pastor should rejoice with those who do rejoice, as well as
weep with those who weep. " And although some years
have elapsed since that joyous period, the recollection of it is
yet vivid, and will never be forgotten." He concludes,—
\"We can almost hope that luxury and refinement will never
penetrate into the mountain wilds of Cambria, to deprive the
honest inhabitants of tlieir innocent and favourite
enjoyments." t Since these lines were written, "luxury and
refinement " have turned over a new lea*', and find their account
in keeping up, instead of putting down, the innocent and
favourite enjoyments of the people.

The kindly sympathy and good-neighbourly feeling which
Bardism inculcated appear in their customs, still preserved,
at marriages. So soon as the important preliminaries were
settled, invitations were sent round — by the chief of the
tribe, if the parties were of inferior rank; by the parents
respectively, if otherwise—to all friends or retainers. As an

inducement to cause a large attendance, games were
instituted, and prizes of value announced. No visitor came
emptyhanded; every person brought something to help towards
setting up in housekeeping the young couple. This they
did with the greater readiness, knowing that when their turn
came they should receive the like. The Cymry, under the
Bardic institutions, had no less than twenty-four different
games, among which we find chess,—likely to have been a
favourite pastime with so studious and refined a race. What
with the scanty leisure the necessity of providing for their
daily subsistence leaves to the mass of the people, and the
discouragements of a sombre religion, national sports, not in
the Principality only, but throughout England, have fSllen
sadly into disuse. Happily, however, the taste for them is
reviving. Among the ancient Cymry the exercises of activity
were very popular,—as hurling a stone, throwing a bar,
running, leaping, swimming, wrestling, riding (which included
manœuvring the war-chariot); also the exercises of weapons,
throwing the javelin, fencing with a sword and buckler,
fencing with a two-handled sword, playing with the
quarterstaff. " From our native pastimes the masculine character
of the people can be most safely recruited. To ' toss the
caber,' or throw the hammer, or 'put the stone,'—these
amusements ofa primitive people help to keep alive a love
of all that tends to strengthen the fibre, to develope the
muscle, and sustain the animal courage. Something is due
to the body, as well as to the mind. And if in towns we pay
most attention to intellectual cultivation, the country may
teach us to qualify that influence by its rough and sturdy
sports."* To Bardism belongs the merit of having made
wise provision both for body and mind.

This outline ofthe character and influence ofthe ancient
religion of Wales, so far as it is derived from foreign
sources, rests on indirect authority. From the copy we have
gathered our ideas of the original. From what Gaul actually
was, we have inferred what Britain, the teacher of Gaul, must
have been. The pure Bardism of the Cymry appears to
advantage in the annals of imperial Rome. The whole of
Britain had been reduced to subjection, saving only the island  
  
  
  * The Times, July 11, 1851.
c2
<!-- Leaf 48, Page: 34 -->
of Mona, or Anglesey. Its inhabitants undauntedly
maintained their independence, and in a noble, though unavailing
patriotism, braved the arms ofthe conquering foe. Suetonius
Paulinus, the general in command, a man of considerable
ability and high reputation, was bent, on crowning the success
that had attended him with the submission, or, in default of
submission, the extermination of the intrepid islanders.
Anglesey, in which the learned Mr. Rowland discovers the
Isle of the Blessed, the Elysian fields of the poets, had always
been a favourite resort, aud remained now the sole possession
of the Bards—that is, of so many of them as had not fled to
distant lands. Tacitus may tell the rest, the date is 61 a.d.
\"The shore of the island was lined with the hostile army,
in which were women dressed in dark and dismal garments,
with their hair streaming to the wind, bearing torches in
their hands, and running like furies up and down the ranks.
Around stood the Druids, with hands spread to heaven, and
uttering dreadful prayers and imprecations. The novelty of
the sight struck our soldiers with dismay, so that they stood
as if petrified, a mark for the enemy's darts. At length,
animated by the exhortations of their general, and
encouraging one another not to fear an army of women and
fanatics, they advanced upon the enemy, bore down all before
them, and involved them in their own fires. The troops of
the enemy were completely defeated, a garrison placed in the
island; and the groves, which had been the consecrated scenes
of the most barbarous superstitions, were levelled with the
ground. It had been their practice to sacrifice on the altars
prisoners taken in war, and to divine the pleasure of their
gods by inspecting human entrails."* As to the stigma
attempted to be thrown on Bardism in the last sentence, in
addition to what has been said already, I can only say, that
had the nations governed by Bardic principles made a rule
to set their prisoners free, they would have risen above, as it
is they stand on the same level with, Christian nations, in
whose wars, continually, prisoners have been put to death.
The intervention of the Druids has been much belied; their
authority was interposed to save life, not to destroy it. " In
nations wholly barbarous," as has been well observed, " the  
  
  
  * Tacit. Annal. xiv. 29-39.
<!-- Leaf 49, Page: 35 -->
slaughter of prisoners of war is indiscriminate; the victim of
the sacrifice is the preserver of the mass."*

The picture which the celebrated historian presents is
designed to inspire horror and disgust, and in the minds of
most of us, reading with Roman eyes, it has done so. Yet
is there no honour due to those who struggle hopelessly in
freedom's cause ? Can no sympathy be claimed for men who
pour out their life's blood to repel the proud invader from
their happy shores ? And in the day of overwhelming
calamity, where should they, the instructors, the guides, the
counsellors, the faithful friends and benefactors, whose noble
lessons inculcated every generous sentiment, trained to every
manly virtue,—where should they be found at the last stand
for life and liberty, but in the midst of their people, to
inspire courage by their presence, and seal the truth with
their examples? The Druids, dying for their altars and their
homes, died the death of the righteous; the martyr's crown
is theirs—the memory of the just is blessed.

The policy of all conquerors is to extinguish nationality in
their newly-acquired possessions. The best passport for the
vanquished to the favour of their masters, if they did but
know it, is to forget that they ever had a country and a name,
any natural rights or hallowed traditions; to sponge out the
whole past, and begin the world again, content to shine, with
a reflected light, from the glory of the empire, into which,
with a gentle or ungentle violence, as the case may be, they
have been adopted. But, unhappily for the interests of
civilization, which are or ought to be paramount, an invincible
ignorance has prevailed, and does prevail, on the subject.
Poland is a modem, Cambria was an ancient example of this
benighted obstinacy. It is said, and I do not doubt the fact,
that the Druids, as foreigners designated Bardism, were at
the bottom of the not unfrequentconspiracies, insurrections,
and revolts; which, flagrant ingratitude ! from time to time
interrupted the mild and beneficent course of the imperial
rule. Hence to exterminate the Druids, and extinguish
Bardism, became a sacred duty, to which the Romans
addressed themselves with the pious energy that distinguished
that religious and disinterested people. Uncompromising
edicts interdicted the Druidic rites, forbad under the severest
<!-- Leaf 51, Page: 37 -->
penalties any to pronounce, or any to obey, the still dreaded
excommunication, and denounced in the language of indignant
humanity the cruelty and the wickedness of human sacrifices.
To the captive or exiled Cymro, who, as an evil destiny
directed his steps, contended a gladiator, or fought with wild
beasts in the arena, or perhaps the faithful servant to a
disgraced senator, shared the not unlikely, equally undeserved
ruin, torture, and death, it must have proved at least some
consolation to know that in his own dear native land, which if
he forgot might his right hand forget her cunning, human
sacrifices were prohibited, and the life of man precious.
These vindictive measures, enforced by the strong hand of
power, produced their usual results; the leaders concealed
themselves, or fled the country into Caledonia, Ireland, and
the lesser British isles, where they endeavoured to preserve
their beautiful and time-honoured faith. Their disciples, who
remained bound to the soil, conformed outwardly, while
inwardly they clung to their national religion with a deeper
love; and preserving a language happily unintelligible to their
political masters, the doctrines would be repeated, wherever
confidence could be placed, and thus the memory of the
sacred poems and tiaditional institutes survived. During
this season of persecution, a Bardic College is supposed to
have been established in the Marches of Scotland, to which
devout persons from Wales and southern Britain repaired on
the solemn festivals. At a later period, the languishing
Bardism of the south was recruited from this healthy source.
The Romans, to their credit be it stated, turned against the
faith they hated a fairer and more formidable weapon.
The schools and academies which they erected, we are
told, greatly undermined the system. As tranquillity was
restored, the conquerors became more lenient; Bardism,
never openly tolerated, was by degrees secretly connived at.
If altars were inscribed ostensibly to Latin divinities, the
terms in which the dedication ran were not critically read,
nor the attendant ceremonies very closely inquired into. As
the empire declined, and the Eagle—unwonted mood—drooped
under disaster and defeat, misgivings entered minds one
might have thought fortified against them, and the civilian
and the soldier, born and nurtured on the banks ofthe Tiber,
did not disdain to bend the knee, and pay the vow Genio
<!-- Leaf 52, Page: 38 -->
loci to the hitherto despised Deity of the race they had
enslaved, from an impression that good fortune could only be
gained by a Roman sacrifice to the British God.*

The introduction of Christianity was favourable to the
revival of Bardism, which was no vain superstition but an
ancient patriarchal religion, descended from the same
fountain of light and truth whence the Gospel of Jesus Christ
drew its inspiration. The seeming idolatrous rites of Bardism
may have been—nay, probably were—symbols of things true,
honest, lovely, and of good report, of which we have lost
the key, and consequently cannot decipher. The Bards
were led to embrace Christianity by their own admirable
maxim, which taught them to believe nothing and to believe
everything; to believe nothing that had not the support of
reason and truth, and to believe everything that had. The
Catholic Church recognised in Bardism an elder sister, whom
she loved and with whom she sympathised; both had been
tried in the furnace of affliction, and their hearts yearned
towards each other. If there were, as afterwards came to
light, principles in Bardism alien to those of Christianity,—
points of divergence,— these, when the two first came
together, were overlooked or disregarded. The ministers of
religion in the old, exercised their functions under the new
dispensation; not only were Bardic orders acknowledged,
but no native was eligible to the Christian priesthood who
did not belong to one of the three privileged classes—was not
either a Bard, a Druid, or an Ovate. This rule remained in
force till the time of Germanus and Lupus, in the early part
of the fifth century.f Indeed, by no very outrageous stretch
of etymology, our word " clergy " has been derived from the
Welsh " cler," a name given to the teachers and learned
men of the Druidical order, who, under the primitive Bardic
system, were employed in going periodical circuits to instruct
the people, and thus corresponding to a priesthood. Divine
worship continued to be performed in the ancient Druidical
circles. A few still found preserve the memory of their
Christian use; as Cam y Groes (the Tumulus of the Cross),
on the mountain of Gelli Onen, Glamorganshire, where
stands an ancient cross. A stone in Cardiganshire is called  
  
  
  * Arch. Camb. vol. ii. p. 20. f Williams's Cymry, p. 169, note.
<!-- Leaf 53, Page: 39 -->
Carreg tair Groes (the Stone of the Three Crosses). The
azure or sky-blue cowl that distinguished the Bard continued
to be worn by the priest, and was afterwards adopted by
the monks,— the Capuchins have it now. Several terms
were borrowed from the Bardic to express ideas in the
Christian theology : thus, " nevoedd," which originally meant
the delightful renovations of eternity, was made to stand for
\"heaven." " Ufern," the state of reprobation in the
doctrine of transmigration, and " oerwern," the seat of the
lowest existence, were both under the Christian system used
for "hell;" and " cythraul," the principle of destruction,
signified "the devil."*


Between Bardism and Christianity these most amicable
relations continued undisturbed to the beginning of the fifth
century, when an unsuccessful attempt to merge the Gospel
in Bardism, and give the home-born a decided preponderance
over the foreign faith, changed the face of things. To one
gifted man belongs the glory or the shame. On the 13th
of November, 354, was born St. Augustine, bishop of Hippo,
the great champion of orthodoxy; and on the same day, in
the same year, his equally able but less fortunate antagonist
was ushered into the world, Morgan, or Pelagius, a
euphonious translation of the Welsh name, which means " sea."
As I shall have to speak of Pelagius again in connexion with
the Church in Wales, I shall only say here, that he advanced
as a cardinal principle the Bardic dogma, " that in the state
of humanity good and evil are so equally balanced that
liberty takes places, and the will is free; whence a man
becomes accountable for his actions, having a power of
attaching himself either to the good or evil, as he may or
may not subject his propensities to the control of reason
and unsophisticated nature." f By this theory Pelagius
interpreted the Gospel. He taught in the celebrated
monastery of Bangor-Iscoed, in which he had been trained, and soon
formed a school of admirers, in which were numbered the
best-informed and most influential of the clergy, who were
already attached to the principles of Bardism. Pelagius
went abroad about 400, and never returned. His school,
however, kept up its numbers and its authority, and about  
  
  
  * Williams's Cymry, p. 174.  
  
  
  t Ibid. p. 101, note.
<!-- Leaf 54, Page: 40 -->
twenty years, more or less, after Pelagius had left the
country, very determined efforts were made to remodel the
Church, and force her tenets into entire accordance with
the doctrines of Bardism. A great crisis brings out the
inherent defects of a system : so it proved with Bardism,
which had ever been an exclusive, aristocratic religion,
ruling wisely and teaching sublime maxims, but ruling by
fear more than love, and listened to with respect rather
than conciliating affection. The Gospel, the patrimony of
the poor, is comprehensive and popular; no wonder, then,
that the body of the nation had cordially embraced it, and
regarded with alarm and repugnance the (as they considered)
insidious attempts to corrupt its simplicity. In their distress
they sent and besought the assistance of the Gallican Church,
who, in 429, in answer to their earnest and repeated
supplications, despatched two of her most learned and zealous
bishops, Germanus and Lupus. The Christian side
conquered, and the defeated party experienced sore humiliation.

Ordination, hitherto restricted to the three degrees of
Bardism, was thrown open, and about the same time a
prince, named Beli, propounded certain articles to which
the Bards were required to subscribe, as an indispensable
condition to employment in Church or State. These articles,
we may fairly infer, turned on the points at issue between
Christianity and Bardism, and confirmed the dicta of the
former.* The greater number ofthe Bardic party conformed,
though, being convinced against their will, it is not unlikely
but that they kept their own opinion still. A section stood
firm. The non-juring Bards complimented their compliant
brethren with the epithets Bardd-Beli (Beli's Bards), and
Over-Veirdd (Sham Bards), from which we may conclude
that the two were not on the most friendly footing.
Following the bent of their aristocratic tendencies, the conforming
Bards became the court clergy, preserving under royal
protection their ancient rank and privileges.

From the laws of Howell Dha, or Howell the Good, we
find that the Domestic Bard appears the eighth in a list of
twenty-four officers of state in regular attendance on the
sovereign. There is another high Bardic functionarymen* Williams's Cymry, p. 175.
<!-- Leaf 55, Page: 41 -->
tioned, the Chief of Song. " He ought to have his land
free, and his seat is next to the judge of the palace. He
ought to commence singing in praise of God, and then in
praise of the king who owns the court, or of another. No
one ought to solicit a favour but the Chief of Song; and in
dividing it with his companions, two shares belong to him.
He claims twenty-four pence from every minstrel at the close
of his instructions. He ought to sleep with the heir-apparent:
his protection is from the time he begins to sing in the palace
until he finishes his last song. The fine for insulting him is
six cows and one hundred and twenty silver pennies. His
value is one hundred and twenty-six cows."* The Chief of
Song was a title borne generally by a musician who had
obtained a chair of precedency,—he was one of tbe
extraordinary officers of the court. After the Chief of Song, " the
Domestic Bard is entitled to sing three songs also. If the
queen desire a song, let the Domestic Bard go and sing to
her as many songs as she desires, but that lowly, that he may
not disturb the mirth in the hall. He is entitled to a buck
or an ox from the booty which the family may obtain from a
neighbouring kingdom, after the king has chosen his third.
He must also sing the Monarchy of Britain (the ancient
National Anthem) while they share the booty. He claims a
chess-board made ofthe horn ofa sea-fish from the king, and
a ring from the queen. His lodging is with the master ofthe
household. In singing with other Bards, he is entitled to the
shares of two men. The fine for insulting him is six cows,
and one hundred and twenty silver pennies. His price is
one hundred and twenty-six cows."-)- He ought to have his
land free, and his horse in readiness. In the castles of the
chieftains there were Domestic Bards enjoying, relatively
speaking, similar privileges; and the middle classes, if we
may use the expression, had their Bards too : an inferior
order, separated from their more elevated brethren by a
strong line of demarcation, which when transgressed on either
side, great was the jealousy and discontent. The Family Bard
was called Teuluwr—his principal duty was the preservation
of the genealogy of his patron. The inferior order bore the  
  
  
  * Probert's Ancient Welsh Laws, p. 123.
f Ibid. p. 101.
<!-- Leaf 56, Page: 42 -->
appellation of Clerwr. As a single family could not. support
them, they procured their maintenance by going from house
to house; hence their name, which means Travelling Bard.*
In the palaces of the nobility the Bards were the tutors of
their children; and the heir, when he succeeded to his
inheritance, cherished with affectionate solicitude the guide and
companion of his youth, who repaid this care and protection
with the grateful tribute of poetic strains. The Bards, to
all, were ostensibly the messengers of peace. From the lordly
keep or the village hamlet they went forth on their errand of
mercy, having and wanting no other safeguard than their
office of conciliation gave them. I have said that they did
this ostensiblv : the truth is, that Bardism, from the fifth and
sixth centuries, gradually declined, till it came to resemble
the ancient Institute in scarcely more than form and show.
The venerated titles and offices remained, but the spirit had
well-nigh departed : the noble independence, the
consciousness of right, the manly resolution—Truth against the world,
had dwindled away. Driven to lean on the patronage of
princes, the Bards descended to servile compliance and low
adulation. " From their position," writes Mr. Stephens,
\"the Bards had much power for good or evil. They might
have raised the standard of moral and intellectual greatness
among their countrymen, and have pointed out more
becoming pursuits than those in which they indulged. But,
instead of preaching peace, they were too frequently the
abettors of war; instead of healing dissensions, they were
prone to widen the breaches already made; and instead of
leading the way to grander views and principles of conduct,
they have, on too many occasions, been the echoes of popular
prejudices, and the tools of ambitious chieftains."+ But the
virtues of Bardism were not always thus obscured; on
occasions they shone forth iu primeval lustre. When the Welsh
Church, or people, were threatened with spiritual or temporal
aggression, the Bards sounded the tocsin of alarm, and their
strength returned as at first; their burning words, darting
with electric force from heart to heart, kindled those patriot
fires which, in the worst of times, have never been wholly  
  
  
  * Stephens's Literature ofthe Cymry, p. 111.
t Ibid. p. 103.
<!-- Leaf 57, Page: 43 -->
extinguished in the breasts of Welshmen. Bardism, at such
a crisis, recovered her ancient dominion, and bowed the hearts
of the people as one man.


I hope that the reader will not think me tedious, if to
this general view I append short notices of a few of the
most celebrated Welsh Bards. The greatest and most
admired of these, and who has maintained his popularity to the
present day, was Taliesin.* He lived in the sixth century.
A mystery hangs over his birth. He was discovered an
infant, floating in a leathern bag, in the salmon-weir
belonging to Elphin son of Gwyddno, a prince of Cardiganshire.
Gwyddno had lost a great part of his territory by an irruption
of the sea. The salmon-weir was all he had to give his son,
and of course it must have been a grievous disappointment
to poor Elphin, coming on the tiptoe of expectation, to find
a child to support, instead of a haul of salmon to support
himself. However, he acted the part of a noble prince and
a good Christian. He took the foundling home, and
brought him up. So soon as he had attained the proper age
he was placed in the Monastery of Llancarvan, under Catwg
the Wise, the first abbot. Here he became acquainted with
Aneurim, and is supposed to have been brought under the
notice of Urien Rheged, a Cumbrian chief, who had fled his
native land and taken refuge in Wales. Urien was a kind
friend to Taliesin, who, as in duty bound, has sung the praises
of his patron. There is one production of the muse of
Taliesin most honourable to him. In a family feud (such things
will be) Elphin was taken prisoner by his uncle Maelgwn,
prince of North Wales, and confined in a strong castle;
Taliesin thereupon addressed to this harsh kinsman a poetical
appeal in behalf of his benefactor. The petition was
successful, Elphin was released; and the Bard had the satisfaction
of serving one friend and winning another, as Maelgwn ever
after became his staunch supporter. A poet would have to
sing a long time nowaday before he sang a captive free.
But ours is literally and metaphorically an iron age. The
life of Taliesin appears to have glided tranquilly on, exempt
from care or sorrow. Always a welcome guest at the castles
of his admirers, he had a little hermitage of his own, to  
  
  
  * Cambrian Plutarch, p. 41, &c.
<!-- Leaf 58, Page: 44 -->
which he could retire when he wished : it was on the Lake
Ceirionydd, in Caernarvonshire. None of the Bards whose
writings are extant went so deeply into the old Bardic
mysteries as did Taliesin, whose whole heart and soul were in the
faith of his fathers. He took the oaths, imposed since the
time of Pelagius, notwithstanding : for he is celebrated, in a
comparatively modern Triad, as one of the three Christian
Bards. Taliesin did not disdain the sweet consolations of
domestic life: he married, and had a son, on whom the
mantle of his father did not descend. However, he tried his
best. The single line of his composition that has been
preserved runs in a doleful strain, expressive of the pains of
production, and reconciling us to the loss ofthe rest. " Hast
thou not heard what was sung by Avaon of honest muse, the
son of Taliesin?—'the cheek cannot conceal the affliction of
the heart.' " Avaon laid down the lyre to take up the lance,
and was one of the bravest and most distinguished warriors
of his time. He is reckoned among " the bull-like chieftains
of Britain;" and, the ruling passion strong after death, as one
of those who continued " slaughtering on their graves." There
is an early poem by Taliesin, addressed to Elphin, in
allusion to the Bard's discovery, an infant in the weir. The
following translation is from the graceful pen of Mrs.
Llewelyn :—  
  
  
  " O Elphin fair ! lament no more,
No man should e'er his lot deplore;
Despair no earthly good can bring,
We see not whence our blessings spring
Kynllo's prayer deem not unheard,
God will maintain his sacred word.
In Gwyddno's weir was never seen
As good as there to-night has been.
Fair Elphin, dry thy tearful face,
No evil hence can sorrow chase :
Though deeming thou hast had no gain,
- Grief cannot ease the bosom's pain.
Doubt not the great Jehovah's power,
Though frail, I own a gifted dower;
From rivers, seas, and mountains high.
Good to the good will God supply.
Fair Elphin ! blest with genius gay,
Unmanly thoughts thy bosom sway;
Thou shouldst dispel this pensive mood,
The future fear not—God is good.
<!-- Leaf 59, Page: 45 -->
  
  Though weak and fragile, now I'm found
With foaming ocean's waves around,
In retribution's hour I'll be
Three hundred salmons' worth to thee.
O Elphin ! prince of talents rare,  
  
  
  My capture without anger bear;
Though low within my net I rest,
My tongue with gifted power is blest;
So long as I to thee am near
Thou never wilt have cause to fear;
Bear thou the Trjune God in mind,
And fear no earthly foe to find."*


Another poem turns on the transmigration of souls; and,
whether Taliesin's or by a later hand, shows how vividly,
even in Christian ages, these ideas were present to the Bardic
mind. Sir John Price pronounces it to be undoubtedly
written by Taliesin. The poem is called " Hanes Taliesin,"
the " History of Taliesin." The following extract is from
the pen of the late Doctor Owen Pugh :j —  
  
  
  '' Primary chief Bard

<!-- Leaf 61, Page: 47 -->

Taliesin is supposed to have died a.d. 570. To the
veneration paid to him by his contemporaries, each succeeding age
has added its tribute of heart-felt praise; and Taliesin is, by
the common voice, proclaimed King of Bards.

Another celebrated contemporary of Taliesin and near his
throne was Aneukim,* a native of Northumberland, the
early inhabitants of which were descended from the Cymric
stock. The father of Aneurim was Caw ap Geraint, a
chieftain of the Ottadini, a northern clan. Trained to arms
by the sad necessity of the times, Aneurim found or made
leisure to cultivate his flowing muse. The invasion of the
Saxons, followed by the disastrous battle of Cattraeth, fought
on the sea-shore, in which the Britons under Urien Rheged
were defeated with great slaughter, compelled Caw, the father
of Aneurim, with the small remnant of his family, most of
whom had died at Cattraeth, to fly his native country, and
seek shelter in exile. The Cymry, his ancestral kindred,
extended their hospitable arms, and gave him a brother's
welcome. He and his surviving sons settled in Anglesey, in
which Maelgwn, prince of North Wales, and titular king of
Britain, gave them a considerable estate. Aneurim was
present at the battle of Cattraeth, had the misfortune to be
taken prisoner, and would have been put to death, had not
his character of Bard delivered him. " I was saved," he
says, in his famous poem the Gododin, "from the shedding of
blood as the recompense of my fair song." t Notwithstanding
he was loaded with chains, and cast into a loathsome dungeon.
\"Pierced were the soles of my feet, lacerated was my knee,
in the house of earth, with a chain of iron around my knees."
Aneurim would have expired under his sufferings, and the
world lost a great name, but for the timely aid of a friend and
fellow-soldier. " From the power of the sword (noble was
the succour), from the cruel prison-house of earth, he
released me; from the place of death, from the cheerless
region; he, Cenau, son of Llywarch, magnanimous and
brave." Aneurim's imprisonment, though severe, was short;
he rejoined his family in time to accompany them to Anglesey.
From some cause unknown, he quitted the island, and went
to South Wales, where he was welcomed by King Arthur, at  
  
  
  * Cambrian Plut. pp. 21-41. t Camb. Brit. vol. i. p. 92.
<!-- Leaf 62, Page: 48 -->
whose court he resided for a while. The service of this
chivalrous prince, honourable as it was, became distasteful to
a mind that, poet-like, yearned for retirement and tranquillity.
Aneurim left Arthur's court and became an inmate of the
college or monastery of Catwg or Cadog, at Llancarvan, or
Llanfei. In this congenial abode, and in the delightful
society of Taliesin, who was a frequent visitor at Llancarvan,
Aneurim spent the remainder of his days. The mutual
regard of Taliesin and Aneurim appears in their writings.*
\"Of the mead and of the horn, and of the assembly of
Cattraeth, I, Aneurim, will frame what Taliesin knows, a song
of participation, which shall be offered by Gododin before
the dawn of the day of toil." " I know the fame of Aneurim,
that celebrated genius, even I, Taliesin, from the banks of the
Lake Ceirionydd." In these sweet monastic shades Aneurim
composed his great poem, the Gododin, the subject of which
is the battle of Cattraeth, in which the poet had fought and
bled. I subjoin a translation of the opening lines, taken from
the " Cambrian Wreath : "—  
  
  
  " Of years though brief, the youthful chief
Was nerved and armed for manly deed;
And for the field, his broad light shield
Hung on his slender thick-maned steed.
Oh ! he was graceful to behold,
With bright blue sword and spurs of gold,
A princely, gay, and ermined garb,
An ashen spear with point and barb.
'Tis not for me to envy thee,
A kinder, nobler part be mine—
To sing thy praise, for brief thy days,
Soon closed that bright career of thine.
Ah ! sooner comes thy bloody bier
Than nuptial day, or festal cheer.
On thee, on thee, shall ravens feed  
  
  
  Ere thou achieve the hero's deed.  
  
  
  Brave Owen's dear and gallant friend,
The fierce prey-birds thy steed shall lend,
His bones alone remain to tell  
  
  
  What spot the son of Marco fell."


Aneurim died in the same year as Taliesin, 570, but
had not so peaceful an end. He was murdered by a blow
from an axe by Eidyn son of Einygan; a crime deservedly  
  
  
  * Camb. Brit. vol. i. p. 93.
<!-- Leaf 63, Page: 49 -->
recorded in a Triad as " one of the three accursed deeds ofthe
Isle of Britain." Gildas the British historian was also a son
of Caw ap Geraint, and is even by some thought to have been
Aneurim himself; for this reason, that where the genealogies
reckon Aneurim as one of the children of Caw, they omit the
name of Gildas, and where Gildas occurs, Aneurim is omitted.
Mr. S. Turner the historian, in his " Vindication of the
ancient Welsh Bards," says that the Gododin may rather be
considered as so many " poetic memoranda of a disastrous
conflict, penned by a friend who had witnessed its events, in
all the confusion in which they had occurred, than a
wellconceived and artfully-ananged series of individual conflicts
like the poem of Homer, which, though genuine as to the
author, yet contains incidents which the poet's invention has
arranged as it pleased him."

The third distinguished exile was Llywakch Hen,* whose
life, extending greatly beyond the ordinary term of human
existence, realised too truly the Psalmist's declaration, that
"his strength then was but labour and sorrow." This
famous Bard was the son of Elidyr Lydanwyn, a prince of
Cumberland, fourth in descent from Coel, seventy-fifth king
of Britain. His mother was the daughter of Brychan, an
Irish chieftain, who, from the disorders of the times, was
compelled to quit his native country, and, after various
wanderings, at length settled in a part of South Wales, called,
after him, Brecknockshire. In the Triads, Brychan is
commemorated as having " introduced the Christian faith to the
Cymry," and as the father of one ofthe "three holy families."
Llywarch's patrimonial inheritance was a forest-tract in
Cumberland, named Argoed. As a resident chieftain, he merited
the praise of being one ofthe "disinterested princes of
Britain." His duty or his inclination carried him to the court
of Arthur, at which he is noticed as one of the " three
intelligent Bards," one of the " three counselling knights;" and,
as if to remind us that there is no such thing anywhere as
unalloyed happiness, one of the "three free and discontented
guests." Llywarch distinguished himself in the courageous
but unsuccessful efforts of his countrymen to repel the Saxon
invaders. He fought at Cattraeth under Urien; four of his  
  
  
  * Camb. Plut. pp. 55-70.  
  
  
  D
<!-- Leaf 64, Page: 50 -->
sons took the field with him, of whom it is thought only one
survived, the deliverer of Aneurim. In the Gododin occurs
this passage, applied to Llywarch :—" Grievously would I be
afflicted for, fondly would I cherish, the illustrious solitary one
and the men of Argoed." From the ruin and desolation of
his country, Llywarch fled to Wales, and found an asylum
under the hospitable roof of Cynddylan, prince of Powys,
who kept his court at Pengweru (Shrewsbury), the ancient
capital of the princes of Powys. The ill-starred chieftain
only exchanged one scene of calamity for another.
Cynddylan was struggling for his crown and life with foreign
enemies, the Loegrians; Llywarch raised his banner for the
defence of his protector; his surviving sons fought under it.
The event was adverse. His children and his friend fell in
battle; and Llywarch found himself a bereaved parent and
homeless wanderer. His poem on the death of Cynddylan
comes from the heart:—" The hall of Cynddylan is silent
to-night, after having lost its lord. Great God of mercy 1
what shall I do? The hall of Cynddylan, how gloomy seems
its roof since the Loegrians have destroyed Cynddylan and
Elvan of Powys!" Urien Rheged, who commanded at the
battle of Cattraeth, and found an asylum in Wales, died in
some border conflict. The poet, in his elegy on Urien,
laments the desolation :—" This hearth, will it not be overgrown
with nettles ? Whilst its protector was yet alive, more
familiarised with it was the foot of the needy petitioner." The
bereft Bard bent his forlorn steps to the vale of Cuawg,
identified with a spot called Dol Giog, near Machynlleth, in
Montgomeryshire. Here one of his poems was written,
addressed to the " Cuckoo of the vale of Cuawg." Llywarch
ended his many and evil days at Llanvor, near Bala, in
Merionethshire, at the reputed age of one hundred and fifty,
in the middle ofthe seventh century. Doctor Davies, author
of the " Latin and Welsh Dictionary," who wrote in the early
part of the seventeenth century, states that he had seen an
inscription in the parish church of Llanvor, over a spot
supposed to contain the ashes of the Bard. No such inscription
exists now, nor is known to the inhabitants to have ever
existed. But the fact that Llanvor received the aged
Llywarch's last breath is confirmed by a secluded spot in Llanvor
which bears the name, Pabell Llywarch Hen,—OldLlywarch's
<!-- Leaf 65, Page: 51 -->
Cot. The sorrows that encompassed the earthly pilgrimage
of Llywarch have imparted to his poetry a deep pathos and
melancholy. The Bard revels in grief.

It is worth while to descend a century or two, in search
of a more cheerful subject. One of the most popular and
admired Bards of the ninth century was Geraint, or Geraint
Bardd Glas, Geraint the Blue Bard. He was a monk of
the Benedictine order of St. David's, presided at an important
convention, which established the principle of consonancy,
tending to improve the rhythm of Welsh verse. He also
wrote a Welsh Grammar, which has gone the way of books
long since. I pass over his graver compositions, and give a
specimen of his lighter and more sportive vein. The title
runs thus,—" The choice Things of Geraint the Blue Bard."
\"A morning bright and calm, and birds joining in song.
Trefoils sparkling with drops of passing dew. A cloudless
welkin, with a plain of smooth turf. The matin-song ofa
lark, and a blackbird on the bush. The trilling shrill note
of the nightingale from a near woody cove. A
pebble-bottomed rippling brook, and pasture decked with flowers. The
discourse of birds, with weather sunny and mild. A sweet
and healthy sky, with a stag on a spangled path. The
concert of hounds. The voice of lambs and sheep. A
sweetlytuned harp, and a sweetly-impassioned lay. A song of ardent
love from the sweet lip ofa fair maid. A grove verdant and
lovely, and fondly-spoken words. Old, sweetly-savoured
mead, and habitual kindness. A softly-sweet glance of the
eye, and love without wantonness. The salute of a fair maid
on a verdant glade. A faithfully-discreet love-messenger
and a friend of good understanding. A secluded
walkingplace to caress one that is fair and slender."* The good
Geraint only dreamt of several of these choice things in waking
dreams, as from the grated window of his cell he looked out
on the green and sunny fields beneath. Next time (for we
shall see Geraint again) we will pay him a formal visit, and
find him at his books.


A Bard of royal degree shall close our list,—Owain
Cyveilioc, prince of Powis, who died 1197. He was the
son of Gruffydh ap Meredyth, created, by King Henry II. of  
  
  
  * Camb. Brit. March 1822.
<!-- Leaf 66, Page: 52 -->
England, Prince ofPowis. The favour wliich Owain showed
the English is thus very naturally accounted for. But when
the patron of his family invaded his native country, Owain
felt and acted as a patriot should, and led his troops, under
the national banner, against the founder of his fortunes.
This Welsh expedition placed no fresh laurels on the
monarch's brow. Matthew Paris observes on the subject a very
expressive silence. The date is 1165. During the next
twenty years, more or less, Cyveilioc frequently got into hot
water with his neighbours; but as this was the temperature
in which the contemporary princes liked to live, and were
not happy out of it, we have no right to assume the
PrinceBard to have been more irritable than his equals. If he
were, his profession of poet, on classical authority, will
excuse him. We hear next of Owain Cyveilioc in 1188.
We find him in Giraldus's black books, because, being
summoned to attend Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury, who
was preaching a crusade in Wales, he refused to come, and
was therefore excommunicated. The Archbishop of
Canterbury's jurisdiction in Wales was a disputed point, so we
need not set Cyveilioc down as a very irreligious prince
because he declined to acknowledge a foreign authority.
Giraldus himself says of Cyveilioc, that " he was a man of
more fluent speech than his contemporary princes, and was
conspicuous for the good management of his territories."
Among three princes whom Giraldus represents as "
distinguished for justice, wisdom, and princely moderation,"
Cyveilioe is instanced as one.

His most famous composition was the " Hirlas," a
drinking song. Convivialities in days of yore entered as largely
into the business of life as they do now. In the Welsh laws,
the hirlas, or horn for the royal use, is required to be of the
buffalo, and to the value of one pound,—relatively speaking,
a large sum in the currency of the age. The hirlas was so
called from its shape and colour; " hir " meaning long, and
\"glas " blue. It was usually filled with mead at the banquets,
and carried round to the guests by the cupbearer. About to
finish this chapter with an extract from the " Hirlas," I
deprecate the censure of that influential body in Wales, the
respected members of the temperance movement. I beg to
remind them, than in the twelfth century the tea-plant was
<!-- Leaf 67, Page: 53 -->
unknown to their honest and hospitable ancestors. Had
their age possessed the privilege wliich ours enjoys, we should
have found the gallant Prince and gifted Bard celebrating in
the " Hirlas " the praises of the cup " which cheers but not
inebriates." Even as it was, moderation ruled in the festive
hall: the hirlas held but half-a-pint. The spirited translation
here abridged is from the pen of Mr. Fenton, to whom we
are indebted for that valuable work, the history of his native
county, Pembrokeshire: —  
  
  
  THE HIRLAS.  
  
  
  Cupbearer, haste, and to thy stand,
Fill the horn in Rhys' hand,—
Fill it high, with pleasure fill,
Nor stint thy generous master's will.
In Owain's hall, thy prince's pride
Is with his warriors to divide
His feasts, his treasures, and the spoil,
Fruit of their valour- and their toil;
For, to no common bounds confined,
Owain's hall is like his mind;  
  
  
  To the carousel of whose mead
A thousand opening portals lead.
Cupbearer, when I want thee most,
With duteous patience mind thy post.
Reach me the horn, I know its power,
Acknowledged in the social hour :
Hulas, thy contents to drain
I feel a longing, e'en to pain.
Pride of feasts, profound aud blue,
Of the ninth waves' azure hue;
The drink of heroes formed to hold,
With art enriched, and lid of gold :
Fill it with bragawd* to the brink,
Confidence-inspiring drink *!
Then filled, the horn to Gwygan bear,
Warrior of the brow severe.  
  
  
  Cupbearer, fairly fill the horn,
Whose cover works of gold adorn !—
Nay, let the frothing mead o'erfiow,
For in excess there's virtue now.
Then, more brilliant, let the wine
Through transparent crystal shine;


* A popular spiced beverage of the day, answering to punch, or
bishop.
<!-- Leaf 68, Page: 54 -->
  
  Which to Grufydd thou shalt bear,
Hero of the crimson spear :
ArwystE's princely chief, who shields
From plundering foes her fertile fields.
Pour out the horn,—for oh, how sweet
With fellow-warriors 'tis to meet,
And to the banquet of my hall
Their country's brave deliverers call!
To dauntless Selyv Gwygyrs stay,
The boon, so well deserved, convey.
Next, Madoc's only son demands
The grateful tribute at thy hands.
Then fill again, and let the hora
To Ynyrs warlike sons be borne,
Who still are found where danger's nigh,
The first to bleed the last to fly.
Then fill again, the cup prepare,
And to Morreiddig give his share;
Patron of the song and Bard,
Liberal source of rich reward.
Pour out, and let the horn be filled
With choicest licpior sweet distilled;
Mead of spear-impelling power
In the battle's deathful hour;
Crown the proud cup, with gold o'erlaid,
And be the grateful tribute paid,
In honour of the mighty dead,
Who for their country's glory bled.
Tlie men I honour here to-day
I owe them more than I can pay :
Then let no stint of mead be known,
Or partial distribution shown.
Somay we live that we may prove
Guests worthy of the courts above,
And when this little Use is o'er  
  
  
  Meet again to part no more;
To live for ever in the sight
Of the Supreme, the Lord of light;
With whom alone the truth is found,
And joys that know no end abound. *

The Athenians asserted that their first forefathers sprang
from the soil of Attica, and, whether they did or no, the
claim was simple and straightforward, and, once admitted,
saved a world of trouble. The Welsh do not bring their
ancestors upon the stage of existence by this summary
process. It is allowed, that they came at some time from some
place; but the exact time when, and the identical place
whence, have not been certainly ascertained, and so remain
open Cjuestions. The most popular, if not the most probable,
opinion is, that, in a remote antiquity, there was a great
movement from the East westward; that this
migratorypeople reached in their progress several uninhabited portions
of our globe,—among others, the country now called Wales,
then the lair of wild beasts, on the occupation of which they
successively entered, and hence derived their names, Cimbri,
Cimmerii, Cymry—Cym or Cyn, in Welsh, signifying " first;"
and so the word Cymry denoting a first, or primitive people.
The preservation of this ancient name solely in the
mountains of Wales is considered as a cogent proof that the
inhabitants of North Wales, at all events, are the true and pure
<!-- Leaf 70, Page: 56 -->
descendants of the Cymry, to whom, as the first colonisers,
the land may, if so high a claim can be put in for anything
terrestrial, be said to belong by Divine right. The Rev.
William Jones, Fellow of Queen's College, Oxford, in a
learned and interesting paper communicated to the Cambrian
Archæological Society, and since published in a more
extended form, under the title, "Vestiges ofthe Gael in
Gwynnedd," on, as he asserts, " the authority of the best historians
and ethnologists, assumes, that the Gael preceded the Cymry
in the possession of the whole of Britain, and was afterwards
driven by them into the Highlands of Scotland, and the
neighbouring islands of Ireland, Man, and the Hebrides."*
As the first-mentioned opinion, that the present Welsh are
the lineal descendants of the ancient Cymry, is maintained by
some of the ablest scholars and antiquaries ofthe Principality,
I must be permitted to give that solution the preference.

The high degree of mental civilization to which, under
the institutions of Bardism, the ancient Britons had attained,
was not in so striking a contrast as some have imagined with
their contracted acquaintance with the arts of life. They
manufactured cloth, first of the hair and wool of animals, and
afterwards of vegetable fibre; they also knew how to bleach
linen; the ashes of the fern, supposed to have been employed,
are still used by the Welsh peasantry for the same purpose.
They also excelled in the art of dyeing purple, scarlet, and
other colours, and possessed some valuable secrets unknown
to other nations.-)- The insignia of the Arch-Druid, the tiara,
breastplate, serpent's stone, &c, show a knowledge of the
vvorking of metals. The light boats or coracles with
which they navigated their rivers Cæsar did not disdain
to adopt. Their cars were admired by the Romans,
taken into use by private persons for their journeys, and
introduced into the public races. There is extant a picture of
one of them, sketched by a British hand, and engraved upon
a British coin.J: The mere existence of a metallic currency
shows a state of society raised very far above barbarism. In
the laws of Moelmud, b.c. 440, " coined monev" is
mentioned as one of the things impossible to be identified, "be* P. 48. t Meyrick's Costumes, p. 9.  
  
  
{ Smith's Ancient Britain, p. 29.
<!-- Leaf 71, Page: 57 -->
■cause each isso perfectly like and similar; and there can be no
claim respecting it, except by testimony, or by the
confession of the thief." Julius Cæsar, in his account of Britain,
deceived by the single-roomed hovels of the poor, represented
whole families as living incestuously. The learned and
talented Archdeacon of Cardigan, the Venerable J. Williams,
suggests the following ingenious explanation. The
inheritance of a sept or tribe was called the Gwely Cenedl, lectus
gentis, bed of that tribe. The sons of a chief, dividing
between them the inheritance on the decease of their parent,
shared, technically speaking, o.ie bed; and hence the
misconception.* I should very much like to present to my
reader a digest of Welsh history within my prescribed
limits, but as that is hardly possible, I crave his indulgence
while there pass before him a few of those distinguished
sovereigns who at various intervals swayed the Cambrian
sceptre, and shed blessings on their land and people.

One of the earliest names of which we have any authentic
information, though very scanty, is that of Dyvnwal
Moelmud. In the translation of a Welsh document, compiled
from "the Chronicles of Kings," we have, "b.c. 441.
Dyvnwal Moelmud, son of Cludno, earl of Cornwall, was a
powerful and praiseworthy king, and he made a survey of
the island, its mountains, its rivers, its forests, and its chief
harbours. He also erected on the banks of the Severn a
city, and it was called Caer Odor, because the small river
which runs through the town is called Odor Nant y Badd;
and this town is called to this day, in both languages, Brysto
(Bristol)." f Dyvnwal Moelmud is enumerated in the Triads,
as " one of the three national pillars of the Isle of Britain,"
because " he reduced to a system the laws, customs, maxims,
and privileges appertaining to a country and nation." He is
also, probably for thc same reason, described as one "of the
three system-formers of royalty in the Isle of Britain."
Geoffry of Monmouth gives a fuller account, which, taken
in connexion with the preceding, will bear to be produced.
\"When he had made an entire reduction ofthe whole island,
he prepared for himself a crown of gold, and restored the
kingdom to its ancient state. This prince established what  
  
  
  * Claudia and Pudens, p. 34. t Camb. Brit. April 1822.
D 2
<!-- Leaf 72, Page: 58 -->
the Britons call the Moelmutine laws, which are among the
English to this day. In these, among other things, of which
St. Gildas wrote a long time after, he enacted that the
temples of the gods, as also cities, should have the privilege
of giving sanctuary and protection to any fugitive or criminal
that should flee to them from the enemy. He likewise
enacted that the ways leading to these temples and cities, as
also husbandmen's ploughs, should be allowed the same
privileges; so that in his day the murders and cruelties
committed by robbers were prevented, and everybody passed
safe, without any violence offered to him."* The law Triads,
cited in the first chapter of this essay, were composed by
Moelmud, to whom belongs also the following constitutional
maxim : " The three pillars of the commonwealth of the Isle
of Britain,—the jury ofa country, the kingly office, and the
functions of a judge." The laws of Moelmud give a very
favourable idea of the civilization to which Cambria had then
attained, and of the good sense and liberality of the
legislator. " There are three common rights of the
neighbouring country and bordering kingdom,— a large river, a high
road, and a place of meeting for religious adoration; and
these are under the protection of God and His tranquillity, so
long as those who frequent them do not unsheath their arms
against those whom they meet. He that offends in this
respect, whether he may be a citizen or a stranger, shall be
visited with the fine of murder, upon application to tho lord
of the district. There are three privileged persons of the
family, who are exempt from manual labour, work, and
office,— the infant, the aged, and the family teacher; for
these are not to bear arms, attend to the horn, nor cultivate
the soil. There are three things which strengthen the
tranquillity of the neighbouring country,— equal privileges, a
common form of government, and the sciences of wisdom,
under the mutual protection of the neighbouring country,
emanating from union and natural right. There are three
leading objects of the neighbouring country,—common and
perfect defence, equal protection of the arts and sciences,
and the cherishing of domestication and peaceable customs.
There are three family arts,—agriculture, or the cultivation  
  
  
  * Bohn's Six Chronicles, p. 122.
<!-- Leaf 73, Page: 59 -->
of the soil, the management of a dairy, and the art of weaving.
And it is the duty of the chief of the tribe to insist that they
are duly taught, and to avouch for their being so in the
court, in the sacred place, and in every assembly for religious
adoration."* Moelmud declares that "every Cambrian,
being a landed proprietor, must keep and support a wife."
Let the bachelor-squires ofthe Principality look to this.

A great stride brings me to another name famous in
British story, that of Caradog or Caractacus. In the
reign of the Emperor Claudius, the statesmen of imperial
Rome, sensible that the prestige of that mighty name hod
begun to decline, aimed by distant conquests to efface the
shame of present humiliations. The triumphal processions
must be made to re-assume something of their former grandeur
and truthfulness. The conquest of Britain was determined
on to retrieve the honour of the Roman arms. The Silures
at that period inhabited South, the Ordovices, North Wales.
The invading legions found no tame submission, no quailing
hearts. " In a convention of the country, and neighbouring
country, under all the limits of the nation of the Cymry,
Caradog the son of Bran was invested with the martial
sovereignty of all the Isle of Britain, that he might oppose
the invasion of the Romans. All the Britons, from king
to vassal, enlisted under his banner at the call of the
country, against foe and depredation." t The courage,
talent, and generalship of Caractacus have had, with
the exception of the brief notice in the Triads, no native
chronicler. The vigorous pen of Tacitus compensates the
defect: the ungrudging praise of an enemy is the highest
tribute. After having stood his ground nine years against
the ablest commanders and best troops of the empire,
Caractacus retreated into the country of the Ordovices, where he
resolved to decide the fate of his country by a single battle.
The policy of this decision may be questioned; but
Caractacus knew what we do not know, the difficulties of his
position and the resources on which he had to depend. We
may fairlv assume, that in taking this course he did the best
which under the circumstances could be done. Caractacus
selected his own ground, and the choice he made proves the  
  
  
  * Probert's Ancient Welsh Laws. f Williams's Cymry, p. 50.
<!-- Leaf 74, Page: 60 -->
excellence of his judgment. " He posted himself," writes
Tacitus, " on a spot to which the approaches were as
advantageous to his own troops as they were perplexing to us.
He then threw up, on the more accessible parts of the highest
hills, a rampart of stones, below and in front of which was a
river difficult to ford. Picked men showed themselves before
the ramparts."* The exact site still exercises the sagacity of
antiquaries. Sir R. C. Hoare discovers it in Brandon Camp
and Coxal Knoll in Shropshire; Mr. Hartshorne, in
CefnCarnedd in Montgomeryshire; a learned contributor to the
"Archæologia Cambrensis,"t fixes on another spot in the
same county, the Breidden Hill, on the banks of the Severn,
between Shrewsbury and Welshpool. Caractacus did not
content himself with the admirable disposition of his troops;
to inspire them with a courage equal to the occasion, he ran
from rank to rank, bidding them remember that on the day's
event hung liberty or slavery; that the Romans were not
invincible, the great Cæsar had been driven back. He
spoke of oppression and dishonour, the yoke of tyranny,
the violated chastity of their wives and daughters. The appeal
went home, the whole army with one voice solemnly, in the
face of the sun and the eye of light, swore " never to yield to
weapons or to wounds." Their resolution unnerved the Roman
general. The river which ran before them, the ramparts and
the steeps which rose in their way, opposed to the assailants
a formidable barrier. For once the soldiers exhibited more
presence of mind than tlieir commander; they demanded to
be led to the attack. Fortune at the first onset favoured
the national cause, the legions were repulsed with great
slaughter, but as new troops rushed up to replace or support
their slain or wounded comrades, the superiority of military
science over mere natural courage became too evident. The
bare-headed and lightly-clothed Britons were unequal, in
close combat, to the helmeted and armour-clad Romans.
They gave way, and all was over. Night found the imperial
forces in possession of the British camp, the family*- and
friends of Caractacus prisoners-at-war. He himself fled to
the court of his step-mother Cartismandua, queen of the
Brigantes, who, to ingratiate herself with the conquerors,  
  
  
  * Tacit. Annal. xii.  
  
  
  t April, 1851.
<!-- Leaf 75, Page: 61 -->
ignominiously put him into chains and delivered him up.
Great as a warrior and free, Caractacus was greater still when
his sword was broken and his hands were bound. The
whole population of Rome, familiar with his name and deeds,
awaited his arrival with intense interest. Nothing was
wanting to give effect to the triumphal procession. " The
Prætorian cohorts were under arms in the field before the
camp. First came the king's dependants and retinue, with
the trappings, collars, and other trophies he had won in
foreign wars; next came his brothers, his wife and daughter;
and last himself appeared before the assembled multitude.
The rest gave way to their terrors. Caractacus, neither by a
downcast expression nor plaintive words, appealed to
compassion; when he came in front of the throne (on which
the emperor was seated) he spoke to this effect:—

\"If to the nobility of my birth, and the splendour of
exalted station, I had united the virtues of moderation
(policy and tact), Rome had beheld me not in captivity, but
a royal visitor and friend. The alliance of a prince descended
from an illustrious line of ancestors, a prince whose sway
extended over many nations, would not have been unworthy
of your choice. A reverse of fortune is now the lot of
Caractacus. The event to you is glorious, and to me
humiliating. I had arms, and men, and horses; I had wealth
in abundance; can you wonder that I was unwilling to lose
them ? The ambition of Rome aspires to universal
dominion, and must mankind, in consequence, stretch their necks
to the yoke ? I stood at bay for years; had I acted
otherwise, where, on your part, had been the glory of conquest,
and where, on mine, the honour of a brave resistance ?
I am now in your power; if you are bent on vengeance,
execute your purpose : the. bloody scene will soon be over,
and the name of Caractacus will sink into oblivion. Preserve
my life, and I shall be to the latest posterity a monument of
Roman clemency."*

Claudius, with a magnanimity that did him honour,
instantly commanded Caractacus and his family to be
unbound, and set free. It is told of the liberated chief, that as
he walked through the streets of the imperial city, and gazed  
  
  
  * Hoare's Giraldus, p. cv.
<!-- Leaf 76, Page: 62 -->
on the sumptuous mansions that adorned it, he remarked to
his attendants, " Is it possible that the Romans, who possess
such splendid palaces at home, can envy me my humble
cottage in Britain?" In what school was this royal
philosopher trained ? where did he learn these sublime lessons ?
From the Druid teachers of his age, from the professors of
that divine yet calumniated faith, whose innocent blood was
so soon to be mingled with their sacrifices. Tradition has
preserved the site ofthe simple dwelling in which Caractacus
resided in earlier aud peaceful years. It is at Dunraven,
anciently Dindryfan, in Glamorganshire. " There is yet
remaining a lofty embankment on the land side of the house,
which appears to have extended across the peninsula, and
formed a formidable barrier in that direction, while the cliff's
rendered the place impregnable on the sea side. This
fortification must be considered to be as old as the time of
Caractacus, if not more ancient."*


I have no sympathy with the inordinate ambition,
selfishness, and cruelty of Roman despotism; but among the many
adventurers who climbed the imperial throne, and died in the
purple, it would ill become me to pass over in silence the
honoured name of Carausius.+ A native of Menapia, or St.
David's, his childish thoughts and longings were riveted on
the ocean that bathed his home. Carausius is said to have
been of humble parentage,—a circumstance, if it were so, that
reflects the greater credit on his after career. A fine, bold,
enterprising youth, he attracted the notice ofthe veteran
seacaptains who visited the British coasts, and by whom his
tastes were encouraged. He became a pupil in the naval
school of Batavia, the great nursery of sailors. On the
completion of his education he entered the service, in which
he soon distinguished himself so much as to earn honourable
mention, first under the Emperor Probus, and then under the
Emperors Cams and Carinus. His abilities were not applied
only to the profession of his choice. As a soldier he was
often called into action, and his signal merits recognised and
rewarded. When in the reign of Maximinian it was found
necessary to station a naval force at Gessoriacum, now
Boulogne, to keep in check the Frank and Saxon pirates,  
  
  
  * Rees' South Wales, p. 681. f Fenton's Pembrokeshire, pp. 44-49.
<!-- Leaf 77, Page: 63 -->
Carausius was appointed to the command of the fleet. This
important and difficult post called into exercise the admirable
qualities with which Carausius was endowed; but, as was
always the case under the imperial rule, well-earned
reputation awakened envy and distrust, and was fraught with peril
to its gifted possessor. Maximinian, on pretence of some
fabricated charge, sent orders to put the admiral to death.
Carausius had timely notice,— he saw his situation,— he was
conscious of his services,—he knew his influence over the
brave comrades who had fought and bled at his side. To
save himself—as who would not have done, with so many
examples of those who had assumed power with far less
pretensions ?—Carausius caught at the vision of empire that
floated before his eyes, and interposed the sceptre to arrest
the axe. He immediately weighed anchor, and sailed with
the whole fleet, carrying with him the fourth legion, then
stationed at Boulogne, to Britain. On landing he assumed
the titles of Augustus and Emperor, and received the
delighted homage of the whole province. Maximinian, who
was not deficient in spirit and energy, manned a fleet and
went in person to put down the rebellion, as he termed it.
But the event was otherwise. The hastily-levied troops and
inexpert seamen of Maximinian were unequally matched
against the veteran adherents of Carausius, to whom, if it
were possible that they could have lacked courage, despair
would have supplied it, since defeat to them was inevitable
destruction. It is certain that Maximinian was worsted; itis
not certain but that he fell into the hands of the victor: if he
did, his release on honourable conditions bears the highest
testimony to the moderation and greatness of mind of
Carausius. The conditions of peace were, the sovereignty of
Britain with the title of Emperor. Carausius reigned seven
years, and rarely by the wearers of the imperial purple were
seven years of supreme power better employed. He defended
the frontiers of Britain against the barbarians of the north;
invited from the continent skilful artists, and a variety of
coins still extant attest his taste, popularity, and magnificence.
He planned and carried out splendid works of public utility.
Auspicious of the future maritime greatness of Britain, the
fleets of Carausius swept the seas from the mouths of the
Rhine to the straits of Gibraltar. Domestic treachery
<!-- Leaf 78, Page: 64 -->
terminated the life of this good and great sovereign. Alectus,
an emmisary of Constantius, who had been raised to the title
of Augustus, came to Britain, and insinuated himself into the
good graces of Carausius, who gave him his confidence, and
made him his chief minister. Alectus, seizing the opportunity,
consummated treason by murder. The scene of the crime
was York, the year 297. Carausius fell in the prime of life;
his noble thoughts died vyith him : but he lives, and will ever
live, in the recollections of his countrymen.

Two centuries more bring me to a hero, whose praises
have been the theme of minstrels down to the present time—
to Tennyson's " Morte d'Arthur." Indeed, so much have
the poets said and sung about him, that his extraordinary
fame has proved his worst enemy; and sensible critics,
without much imagination in their composition, convinced that
no one man could have done a hundredth part of the
wonderful things ascribed to Arthur, have come to the conclusion
that there*never was such a prince at all; that Arthur
Pendragon is a myth. Peter Schemill lost his shadow—that was
bad enough; but poor Arthur, subjected to the tender
mercies of antiquarians, has lost his substance. Leaving the
mythological Arthur in the hands of the learned, to be dealt
with as they in their wisdom may think fit, I proceed to lay
before my reader so much as is known of the Arthur of
history. Meirig ap Tewdrig, a prince of the Silurian Britons,
whose country is now a part of South Wales, towards the
close of the fifth century visited Cornwall, inhabited by a
people of kindred extraction and language with the natives
of Wales, and united with them in one common league
against the Saxons. During his stay in Cornwall, a son was
born to Meirig at a place called Tindagel; that son was
Arthur.* Of his childhood and youth nothing authentic is
known. His father Meirig, in consideration of his influence
or his abilities, had been chosen Pendragon, or head of the
confederacy of British princes. On his father's death,
Arthur, at an early age, was by the common voice elected
his successor.

rarity. Churchyard, in his " Worthiness of Wales," has given

those which attended the inauguration of Arthur in 517 :—
\"The appoynted tyme of the solemnitie approching, and all
being readie assembled in the citie of Carleon, the
Archbishop Dubright was conveighed to the palace with royal
solemnitie, to crowne King Arthur. Dubright, therefore
(because the court then lay within his diocese), furnished
himself accordingly to perfourme and solemnize this charge
in his owne person. The king, being crowned, was royally
brought, to the cathedrall church of that metropoliticall see.
On either hand of him, both the right and the left, did two
archbishoppes* support him. And sower kings, to wit,
Angusell king of Albania, Caduall king of Venedocia, Cader king
of Cornewall, and Sater king of Demetia, went before him,
carrying sower golden swords. The companies also and
concourse of sondrie sorts of officers played before him
melodious and heavenly harmonic" -j- Cerdic and the West
Saxons had gained a firm footing in England, and were
pursuing the British forces very hard; Arthur had hot work
before him, and I am afraid that his mind was a long way
off as he walked in that stately procession. When next we
hear of him, it is on the battle-field.


Arthur fought the Saxons twelve times; had he
conquered the first time, it is probable that he would not have
had to fight the other eleven times. The number of the
engagements proves the determination and perseverance of
the invaders. Even so long ago as that the English did not
know when they were beaten. Arthur's great battle, in
which he gained a decisive victory, and brought Cerdic to
terms, stands last in the list of Nennius. The event
established Arthur's reputation as a great captain. The battle
was fought in the neighbourhood of Bath, in 520, near the
hill (Camden writes) now called " Bannesdown, hanging
over the little village of Bathstone, and showing in his day,"
as he tells us, " its bulwarks and rampire." The Welsh still
know the adjacent vale on the Avon by the name
NantBadon. In allusion to this victory^ an ancient Bard,
supposed to have been Taliesin, sings,—  
  
  
  * London and York.  
  
  
  t P. 29.
<!-- Leaf 80, Page: 66 -->
\"Woe to the miserable ones, on account of the battle of Badon !
Arthur was at the head of the valiant with their blood-red blades.
He revenged on his foes the blood of his warriors—  
  
  
  Warriors who had been the defence of the sovereigns of the North.'


Llywarch here commemorates another battle fought at
Llongborth (Portsmouth) :—  
  
  
  " At Llongborth were slain to Arthur
Valorous heroes, who hewed down with steel.  
  
  
  The emperor was he, and chief conductor of the toil of war."


In the brief intervals of repose Arthur kept his court at
Caerleon, with befitting splendour. In the Triads* we find
"the three fair ladies of Arthur's court—the three wives of
Arthur,"—not all at once, it is to be hoped! — "the three
free and dissatisfied guests"—more free than welcome—"the
three golden-tongued knights of Arthur's court; the wisest
of all the wise of their time were they, and so fair and gentle
their deportment, and so eloquent and placid their whole
discourse, that none could fail in giving them what they
required; the three privileged knights ofthe court of Arthur,
—Eithew son of Gwrgawn, Coleddawg son of Gwyn, and
Geraint the Tall son of Cymmanon the Aged. They were
plebeians, and the sons of vassals; but their word, and their
disposition for honesty, urbanity, gentleness, wisdom, bravery,
justice, mercy, and every praiseworthy quality and science,
either in peace or in war, were so good that the court of
Arthur and its privileges were free for them." That
Arthur instituted the order of the Knights of the Round
Table is likely to have been the fact. Knightly honour was
exceedingly sensitive, and a better device to cut off occasions
of jealousy could not have been hit upon.

Uxorious as he was, Arthur was not happy iii his
conjugal relations; upon which subject, by the way, his
ideas were very lax. One wife was forcibly carried off
by Melva, king of Somersetshire, to Glastonbury.
Arthur collected his friends from Cornwall and Devonshire to  
  
  
  * Ancient Welsh Laws, pp. 410-412.
<!-- Leaf 81, Page: 67 -->
the rescue. To avert bloodshed, the clergy interposed; their
counsels were respectfully listened to and followed; Melva
restored, and Arthur received, the abducted queen; and so
pleased were both kings with the result, that they liberally
rewarded the monks of Glastonbury for their opportune
interference.* Arthur received another wound, not so easily
healed, from a hand he could least have anticipated. Medrod,
Arthur's nephew, son of his only sister Anna, is described as
one of the three kingly knights of this gallant court. He
was a man of very fascinating manners; but, in an age in
which morality was at a low standard, fell even lower. In
high favour with his uncle, whose confidence he possessed,
on an occasion when Arthur was absent for the defence of
his country, Medrod incestuously stole the affections of his
queen, and, availing himself of his position as regent of the
kingdom in Arthur's absence, conspired with another
traitorous counsellor, Iddog, to ruin the sovereign, kinsman, and
benefactor whom he had irreparably injured. Seizing his
opportunity, Medrod threw off the mask, and laid waste with
fire and sword his uncle's possessions in Cornwall. So soon
as intelligence reached Arthur of this ungrateful defection,
he retaliated on the estates of Medrod. This civil, or rather
domestic feud, gave a severe blow to British independence,
since it lost to his country the services of her great defender.
In 542 Arthur fell in the battle of Camlan, in which his
treacherous nephew fought in the Saxon ranks. The scene
of tfiis catastrophe was near Camelford, on the banks ofthe
Camel or Alan, anciently called Camblan. Medrod reaped
the just reward of his perfidy, and found on the same field a
bloody grave. Another account supposes Arthur to have
been mortally wounded at Camlan, but to have died at
Glastonbury, whither he had been immediately conveyed by his
friends, and where his body was interred. The soldier-like
qualities, the skill and genius of Arthur, arrested, but were
unequal to prevent, the subjugation of his country. It is
much to be said, that throughout his life he kept the invaders
at bay.


The portrait of Arthur's court conveys to the mind the
idea of a gallant, discriminating, noble-hearted prince, who  
  
  
  * Turner's Anglo-Saxons, vol. i. p. 285.
<!-- Leaf 82, Page: 68 -->
recognised and rewarded merit in whatever condition it was
found. He was not pure from the sensual vices of his age;
yet \va3 amenable to remonstrance, to a degree unusual in
the wielders of supreme power in those rude times. "
Meeting a prince in Glamorganshire who was flying from his
enemies, Arthur was at first desirous of taking by force the
wife of the fugitive. His military friends, Cei and Bedguir,
persuaded him to refrain from the injustice, and to assist the
prince to regain his lands. A British chief having killed
some of his warriors, Arthur pursues him with all the avidity
of revenge. At the request of St. Cadoc, Arthur submits his
complaint to the chiefs and clergy of Britain, who award
Arthur a compensation."* Arthur also, we are told,
possessed a great zeal for the Christian religion, and several
devoted men found in his dominions a safe asylum from pagan
persecution. Nor will a fact candour compels me to mention
damage, in the judgment of my Protestant friends, the
religious character of Arthur, but rather will considerably
improve it,—that once upon a time he " plundered St. Paternus,
and destroyed a monastery." The caliburno, or sword of
Arthur, was presented by Richard I. (how it came into his
possession we are not informed), as a valuable gift, to the King
of Sicily.

Six hundred years and more after the death of Arthur,
in 1189, his grave was discovered at Glastonbury^: Giraldus
Cambrensis saw and has described it. King Henry H., on a
visit at Kilgeran Castle, Pembrokeshire, heard a Bard sing
the mighty deeds of Arthur, his death in battle, and his burial
at Glastonbury, where certain pyramids of stone marked the
spot. The king's interest was strongly excited, and he wrote
to the abbot and monks of the monastery, adding, " that the
body had been buried very deep, to keep it from the Saxons,
and that it would be found, not in a stone tomb, but in a
hollowed oak. There were two pyramids, or pillars, at that
time standing in the cemetery of the abbey. They dug
between these till they came to a leaden cross, lying under a
stone, which had this inscription, and which Giraldus says
he saw and handled: "Hic jacet sepultus inclytus Rex  
  
  
  * Turner's Anglo-Saxons, vol. i. p. 285.
<!-- Leaf 83, Page: 69 -->
Arthurus in insula Avallonia."* Below this, at the
depth of sixteen feet from the surface, a coffin of hollowed
oak was found, containing bones of an unusual size. The
leg bone was three fingers (probably in the breadth) longer
than that of the tallest man then present. The skull was
large, and showed the marks of ten wounds; one had a cleft
in it, and the opening still remained, apparently the mortal
blow. The bones were removed into the great church at
Glastonbury, and deposited in a magnificent shrine, which
was afterwards placed, in obedience to the order of Edward I.,
before the high altar. He visited Glastonbury with his queen
in 1276, and had the shrine of Arthur opened to contemplate
his remains. They were both so interested by the sight, that
the king folded the bones of Arthur in a rich shroud, and
the queen those of his wife, which also lay there, and deposited
them reverentially in the tomb."* The legendary Arthur
has enough in common with the real hero to show that the
materials out of which the poets constructed their fables were
historic facts; but Arthur of Britain, the renowned in arms,
had no familiar spirit to do his bidding, save only the lofty
and patriot soul which God had given him : no magic was
his, but unswerving fidelity to his country's cause and
untainted truth. And if ever the day return—may it never be !
— that such another hand be required to repel the invading
foe, sure I am that the race which has Arthur's blood in their
veins will not fail at the crisis.

I regret much that my straitened limits compel me to pass
over in silence many illustrious names; I pause at that of
Hywell Dda, or Howell the Good. He was the grandson of
Roderic the Great, king of All Wales; who injudiciously, as
the event proved, but equitably, according to the prevailing
law of gavel-kind, on his death-bed divided his dominions
between his three sons, Cadell, Anarawd, and Mervyn. To
Anarawd he gave Aberfraw, or North Wales; to Mervyn,
Powis, comprising all the country between the Wye and the
Severn; and to Cadell he allotted the province of Dinevwr, in
South W"ales.* The sons were not satisfied with the division;  
  
  
  * Warrington's History of Wales, p. 146.
<!-- Leaf 85, Page: 71 -->
they quarrelled and fought: Cadell got the better of his
brother Mervyn, and made himself master of Powis, which,
together with his hereditary possessions, he, dying in 907,
bequeathed to his son Howell, who thirty-three years
afterwards succeeded his cousin, Idwal Voel,—leaving sons of his
own, who were set aside in the sovereignty of North Wales—
and thus reunited the kingdom which his grandfather Roderic
had partitioned. The succession to the respective
principalities of Wales is very difficult to understand; sometimes
primogeniture determined a right, sometimes it went by
election; every change found and left many claims lying
dormant, till a chance offered for their revival and establishment.
The title of Howell to the whole dominions he ruled was not,
strictly speaking, a sound one, though custom may have
legalised what, from imperfect knowledge, reads to us like an
act of spoliation. Howell had the best interests of his country
at heart. He saw around him a great many abuses and
anomalies, and he bent his mind to correct and improve them.
But he was not a precipitate reformer; he entered on his
patrimonial inheritance in 907, and took no public step till 926.
Still less was he narrow-minded. Rome, fallen as she was,
under a succession of unfaithful pontiffs, each one worse than
the last, to the simple inhabitants of the far west was still the
Queen of Cities, the centre of faith and civilisation. Thither
Howell set forth, attended by a train of bishops, to consult,
as Caradog of Llancarvan writes,* "with wise men respecting
the means of improving the laws ofthe realm of Cambria, to
obtain a knowledge of the laws of other countries and cities,
and to know the laws which the emperors of Rome put in
force in the Isle of Britain during their sovereignty."

After he had satisfied his thirst for information Howell
returned home, and summoned a convention of the nobility,
clergy, and learned men, to meet at the White House on the
Tav, Carmarthenshire, a royal hunting-seat, so called, because
it was built of wattles of white rods. The site is near the
ruins of Whitland Abbey, above Tenby. The convention
consisted ofa hundred and forty ecclesiastics, of various degrees,
nobles and barons not specified, and six men of best repute for  
  
  
  * Translation by Powell, pp. 50-53. Camb. Plut. 98-110.
<!-- Leaf 86, Page: 72 -->
wisdom and learning from every commote.* The convention
was summoned at the beginning of Lent, but no business was
transacted till the close of the sacred season. While it lasted
the good Howell remained with his prelates, nobles, and
counsellors, "in prayer and fasting, craving the assistance
and direction of God's Holy Spirit, that he might reform the
laws and customs of the country of Wales, to the honour of
God, and the quiet government of the people." The
convention appears to have been summoned to give the national
sanction and approval to the king's designs. Twelve of their
body, as ordinary commissioners, with a head commissioner,
Blegwryd, chancellor of Llandaff, the greatest scholar and
best lawyer of his day, were appointed by the king to examine
the existing Welsh laws, and from them, with such
modifications as their united wisdom might suggest, draw up an
improved code. The commissioners, after a diligent search,
chose the laws of Dyvnwal Moelmud as the basis of their
reformed system, and having completed their task, submitted
their labours to the judgment of the convention, by whom
they were approved and ratified; and they afterwards received
the royal assent. Howell ordered three copies to be written
out in full; one for his own use, another to be deposited at
the palace of Aberfraw, and a third at Dinevwr. That the
amended laws should want nothing to give them weight and
authority, the Archbishop of St. David's pronounced
excommunication against all who should disobey them. The new
institutions had received all the support whicli the authorities
in Church and State could give them; still Howell was of so
religious a spirit, and cherished so deep a reverence for the
Holy See, that he was not content till in person, attended by
the Archbishop of St. David's and the Bishops of Bangor and
St. Asaph, he had presented himself at the Papal Court, and
received the confirmation of the sovereign pontiff, as the
finishing stroke to his noble and patriotic design. Howell
visited Rome on two occasions, about 926 and 930; of
which period a Roman Catholic historian writes,—" The
Roman See appears to have been in a state of disgraceful
dependence on certain Roman women, who, influential as  
  
  
  * A commote comprised twelve manors and two hamlets.
<!-- Leaf 87, Page: 73 -->
they were capricious, placed therein their favorites or sons :
a state in which the Papal See might have been compared to
a captive in chains, to whom, being deprived of freedom, we
are not to impute the disgrace which he endures."*
However, the vices which deformed the Papacy were little, if at
all, known in remote Britain; and if Howell felt persuaded
that the Pope's sanction was necessary to give validity to his
reforms, and induce his subjects to respect and obey thera
better, he was right in seeking the approbation of the Holy
See, by whatever unworthy occupant it might have been
possessed.

The laws of Howell the Good throw much light on the
state of society in Wales in the tenth century. The Codes
is divided into three books: — The first contains the laws
relating to the court; the second, the laws of the country;
and the third, the prices of wild and tame animals, and the
things appertaining to them. I may premise that there is
not a single offence known to the law which is not
commutable for a fine, varying according to the rank of the
party injured. The life of the king, just as the life ofthe
peasant, has its price; The laws relating to women are
numerous and minute; but if they be taken as a sample of the
spirit of feudal institutions, leave us nothing to regret in
their abolition. The laws which regulate the court fix the great
officers ofthe king's household at sixteen, of whom the chaplain
is the second, the domestic bard eighth in order. The queen's
household is limited to eight, of whom the priest is second.
\"Three times in the year the twenty-four officers are entitled
to receive their woollen garments from the king, and their linen
garments from the queen; viz. at Christmas, Easter, and
Whitsuntide." The queen has a very liberal allowance, and
the queen's servants are not badly off either. " The king
must grant the queen a third of his income from landed
property, and the servants of the king must also give a third of
theirs to the queen's servants. The fine for insulting the
King of Aberfraw (ancient capital of North Wales) shall be
paid as follows : " A hundred cows from every hundred in his
(the offender's) lordship, a rod of gold as long as himself  
  
  
  * Dollinger, vol. iii. p. 136.
t Ancient Welsh Laws, pp. 87-270.  
  
  
  E
<!-- Leaf 88, Page: 74 -->
and as thick as his little finger, and a dish of gold as broad
as his face, and as thick as a husbandman's nail who has been
a husbandman for seven years." The heir-apparent has his
table, his bridles, his steeds, his dogs, his rings, his ornaments,
and his arms from the king. He must not part with any of
them without the king's leave, and at his death his steeds and
his dogs revert to the royal donor : he must not leave the
king for a single night, even if he should desire it. The order
in which the court are to sit round the fire is rigidly
prescribed. " The first is the king, who must sit next the fire;
next to him the torch-bearer, then the guest, then the
heirapparent, then the master of the hawks, then the foot-holder
to be about the dish with him, and then the physician to be
about the fire with him. Next the fire on the other side sits
the domestic chaplain, to bless the food and chant the Lord's
Prayer; and the crier must strike the pillar above his head.
Next to him sits the judge of the court, then the bard of
precedency, and the smith of the court sits on the end of the
form before the priest."

The master ofthe household had a capital appointment,
but a great deal to do: among other things, it devolved upon
him to make up family jars, and everybody must feel that
he ought to have been well paid for so thankless an office.
\"If the king receive any man of the family in anger, the
master ofthe household must invite him into his presence,
and reconcile him to the king." Marauding expeditions into
the neighbouring territories are spoken of in the coolest way
in the world; the master of the household has laid down, in
black and white, what he is to do " when it is necessary for
the family to go to pillage." The domestic chaplain " has
his lodging with the sexton,"—this sounds rather infra dig.—
"and the scholars with him; his allowance is one dish of
meat and a hornful of liquor." There is a long list of fees
and dues, on which the domestic chaplain did not starve.
The last clause runs thus,—" No bishop must present any
person to the king's chapels without his permission." There
is a nut for my Ultramontane friends to crack. The steward
of the household has one rather onerous duty,—" he must
swear for the king." The master of the hawks " has his
lodging in the king's barn, lest his birds should be injured by
the smoke. He must bring his vessel to the palace to get a
<!-- Leaf 89, Page: 75 -->
drink in it; for he ought only to quench his thirst, lest his
birds be injured by neglect. He is entitled to the skin of
a stag in October and the skin of a hind in May, to make
gloves to train his hawks, and also to make their jesses. He
must be honoured with three presents the day his hawk kills
one of these three birds—a bittern, a crane, or a heron. He
claims the mantle in which the king rides on the three great
festivals."


The judge of the palace " receives his pillow and
bedlinen from the queen, while the cushion upon which the king
sat during the day shall be under him at night. His steed
must be between the king's steed and the wall, and is entitled
to two shares of the provender. He is entitled to receive a
chess-board, made of the bone of a sea fish, from the queen;
and another from the domestic bard; and these toy ornaments
he must neither sell nor give whilst he lives. He ought to
receive his steed from the master of the horse, complete in
every respect, and ready saddled when he mounts for the
purpose of riding. The porter must open the large gate for
him when coming to the palace, and in going in and out; for
he must never go through the small gate, whether in going or
coming." The master of the horse " claims fourpence for
every horse which the king gives, except to three men; these
are the bishop, the master of the hawks, and the buffoon.
He receives nothing for a horse given to the bishop, because
he is the king's confessor, rises up before him, sits behind
him, and holds his sleeves while the king washes himself.
He receives nothing from the master of the hawks, for the
king serves him on three occasions: when he pursues his
hawk, the king holds his horse, as he holds his horse both when
he alights, and when he mounts he must hold his stirrup, and
he holds his horse when he goes upon his necessary duty.
Neither does he get anything of the buffoon, because he
must tie the halter round the horse's tail, and ride the
contrary way when he goes from the palace. The page of the
chamber must take care of the chamber, make the king's bed
(of straw), and do all necessary business between it and the
hall. He is entitled to the king's old bed-clothes." The
duties and privileges of the domestic bard have been detailed
in a former chapter. The crier " must proclaim silence, and
strike the pillar above the head of the priest." The chief
<!-- Leaf 90, Page: 76 -->
huntsman, " from the eighth night of February, must take
his dog, his horns, and his greyhounds, to go and hunt the
young stags. His horn must be buffalo, and its value is one
pound. From that time to the middle of summer, being the
feast of St. John, he must hunt the young deer; and during
that time he is not bound to do justice to any one who may
have a claim upon him, unless it be one of his fellow-officers.
Some say that he ought only to swear by his horn and his
leashes. He is entitled to the skin of an ox in winter to
make leashes, and to a buck's skin in summer to make boots.
On the morrow after the feast of St. John, being the middle
of summer, he must go to hunt deer; and unless he can be
taken before he has risen from his bed and put on his boots, he
is not obliged to do justice to any one who has a claim on him."
The physician " must give medicine gratis to all the officers of
the palace, unless it be one of three dangerous wounds : these
are, a blow on the head which penetrates the brain, a thrust in
the body which penetrates the bowels, and the breaking of one
of the limbs. For every one of these three dangerous wounds
the physician is entitled to one hundred and eighty pence and
his meat, or to one pound without his meat, and also the bloody
clothes. He claims twenty-four pence for a tent for a wound,
a plaister of red ointment is twelvepence, and one of
medicinal herbs is eightpence." The butler " must take care of
the mead cellar, and the bottles that are irT it. The
proportions of lawful liquor are, to fill the vessels in which tliey are
poured with one part of ale, half of it of bragget (a spiced
drink), and one third of mead." The door-keeper "must
clear the way before the king with his rod of office, and
whoever he may strike upon the road, at the length of his arm
and his rod, can obtain no redress, even if he may desire it.
He must not sit in the hall, but present himself upon his
knees in doing the king's business." The cook " must ta3te
of every joint of meat that is prepared for him, and he claims
the fragments and suet. He ought to carry the last dish and
place it before the king, and then the king must present him
with his meat and drink." The torch-bearer "ought to hold
the candle before the king, and to be about the dish with
him whilst he is eating, and the broken bread and fragments
which fall over the dish are his." The sixteen officers of the
king's household are to have their land free and their horse
<!-- Leaf 91, Page: 77 -->
in readiness. The duties and privileges of the queen's
household are also carefully set down. They are also to have
their land free and their horse in readiness. The maid of
honour " is entitled to the queen's old clothes, her old shifts,
sheets, bridles, and old shoes. Her bed is in the chamber, that
she may hear the least word which the queen may utter."

In addition to these high officers of state, the law
condescends to particularise the duties and perquisites of several
inferior servants. The groom ofthe rein " must be in every
place in the absence of the master of the horse; he claims
the king's rein-caps in which he rides, with his old bridles,
boots, spurs, his old gold-harnessed saddles, and his old
packsaddles." The foot-holder " must hold the king's foot in his
lap, from the time he begins to sit at the banquet until he
goes to sleep; and he must rub the king; and during that
space of time he must guard him, lest he should suffer any
misfortune. He has the privilege of eating upon the same
dish with the king, with his back towards the fire." The
bailiff of the manor " must superintend agriculture, and supply
all the necessaries for the palace; he claims the fines and
amercement-fees of the king's demesnes." The apparitor
\"must stand between the two pillars, with his rod in his hand,
lest the house should take fire whilst the king is eating and
drinking with his officers; but he must not sit in the hall.
If the apparitor be caught sitting, and be insulted for it,
whilst causes are tried, he can only claim a sieve of oats and
an egg-shell for the insult." The porter has his house over
the gateway, and a great many perquisites. " He is entitled
to a handful of every present that comes through the gate;
to a billet of wood from every burden of fuel which is brought
through the gate which he may be able to pull off without
stopping the horse, having his hand on the gate. From the
swine taken in pillage that shall pass through the gate he
shall have the sow which he can, with his one hand, lift up
by her bristles, so that her feet may be as high as his knees;
and every pig that comes through the gate without a tail shall
be his property. He must do errands in the palace gratis, but
he claims the leavings of the cheese which he toasts." The
baker " is not obliged to rise to any one when she is baking."
The smith " must do what is necessary for the court gratis,
<!-- Leaf 92, Page: 78 -->
except three things; these are, a stirrup, the rim of a kettle,
or a broken ploughshare."

The laws in the second book would interest a
professional man, but are for the most part too dry and technical
for the general reader. In the proceedings of the courts of
justice mention is made of grand and petty juries. Among
other oaths taken in cases of debt, we find that it was not
unusual to pledge the baptismal vow. " The Church and
the King ought to enforce the baptismal vows, for God is
accepted in lieu of a surety." Landed property, on the death
of a father, was divided equally between his sons. A son
came of age at fourteen, a daughter at twelve. In North
Wales a daughter could not succeed to property onthe
father's side. On the death of a bishop the king was heir to
his private property. His majesty, we may remark, stood in
the place of next of kin and heir-at-law to a great many
persons, particularly place-holders; so that he had back again
what he gave away. " Whoever possesses land upon the
margin of the sea-shore has a right to possess as much in
breadth as the land upon the beach; he may make a weir,
or other things, upon it, if he pleases. But if the sea throw
anything upon the land, or upon the beach, they belong to
the king; for the sea is the king's collector. Gardens ought
to be manured every year. A fallow ought to be in tillage
two years, and verdant ley land for the same time. Land
manured by turning cattle in it must be in tillage three
years. Manured land ought to be in tillage four years.
Verdant wood-lands for the same time; and fallow-land that is
manured four years also." I copy the following from the
third book : — " The furze is not to be set on fire except in
the month of March. If swine enter a house and scatter
about the fire, so as to set the house on fire, and the swine
escape, let the owner of the swine pay for their act. If the
swine be burnt, then both house and swine are equal, for both
are stupid. Therefore, as both have equally suffered
according to law, there is nothing to be redeemed, but the injury of
the one must be set off against the injury of the other."

In the table of the value of animals, " a colt, if it attain
three years osage, is worth 60d., and then it will be time to
tame it with a bridle, and to teach it its duty, whether as
<!-- Leaf 93, Page: 79 -->
a stallion, a palfrey, or a serving horse; — the value ofa
palfrey is I20d.; of a pack-horse the same; of a serving-horse,
60e?.; of a wild horse, 60a?.; of a stallion, 180c?. A year's
trial is to be given on sale ofa horse : " if it become restive on
being backed among a multitude of men and horses,
onethird of the price must be returned. If a borrowed horse
become ill, or obtain any other bruise, let another be given
in its place till it do recover, and until it do recover let it
remain with the borrower. A filly, when three years old, is
worth 60d.; and then she must be set to work; her qualities
are to draw a car up steep ground and down it, and to breed
colts. A heifer's value is 40***?.; a cow in her prime is worth
60e?.; the value ofa sow is 30d.; ofa boar, 90c?.; the value
ofa yearling lamb, 2d.; of a ewe, 80?.; of a ram, 24c?. The price
of goats is the same. The price of a cat is 4c?.; her qualities
are to see, to hear, to kill mice, to have her claws whole, and
to nurse and not devour her kittens. A goose is worth le?.;
a gander, 2o?.; a hen, Jo?.; a cock, 2c?. The king's
buckhound, trained, is worth a pound; untrained, 120c?. The
king's greyhound, trained, is worth 120rf.; untrained, 6O0?.
The king's lapdog is worth a pound; the lapdog ofa freeman
120c?. Whatever dog a stranger may possess, its value shall
be the same as that of a dunghill dog; whoever possesses
a dunghill dog, its value is 4c?." A hawk's nest is worth one
pound; the young unfledged hawks are worth 1206?.; and
after they are fledged, and become firm, they are worth one
pound if they belong to the king; if they belong to a
freeholder, fledged, they are worth 120c?.; unfledged, 60c?. Of
skins, the second highest in value, that ofa martin, is worth
24c?.; and the highest in value, a beaver's skin, 120c?. Tbe
valuation proceeds through live and dead stock to furniture,
&c, till it has exhausted the — for that day — by no means
scanty list of accessories to the comfort and convenience of
life. Howell the Good closed a long and peaceful reign in
948, leaving behind him the reputation of one of the wisest,
most conscientious, and enlightened princes who ruled in
Wales.


I shall close this short series with the name ofa prince,
who, when the fortunes of his country were at the lowest
ebb, revived, and, through a reign of nearly fifty years,
sustained them with indomitable perseverance and true dignity,
<!-- Leaf 94, Page: 80 -->
Llywelyn ap Jorwerth, deservedly honoured as Llywelyn the
Great. Throughout his whole reign, Llywelyn contended
with various success against the aggressions of his powerful
neighbours the English kings, who were bent on reducing
Wales to subjection.

This appears to be the proper place to introduce a brief
statement ofthe claims which the kings of England asserted
over Wales, their progressive occupation of the southern part
ofthe country, and extended influence and authority.
Roderic the Great, about 876, gave a pre-eminency over the
other princes to the kings of North Wales; he ordained that
the princes of South Wales and Powis should each of them
pay yearly to the sovereign of North Wales a tribute, called
Maelged, of sixty-three pounds, as a mark of subordination.
But the royal tribute which was due from Cambria to the
imperial crown of London, agreeably to the ancient laws, was
ordained in future to be paid by the princes of North Wales.*
Warrington says, that the laws of Howell the Good recognise
the tribute-money as due; but the translation which I have
used contains no such admission. The tribute, as we may
suppose, was very offensive to the Welsh, and very
irregularly paid. In 961, Edgar, king of England, thought it
worth while to go in person, with an army, to collect the
arrears; but on an explanation, that the wolves with which
North Wales was then infested had destroyed the sheep and
other cattle, he with great generosity contented himself with
demanding three hundred wolves' heads a-year: this number
was sent for three or four years, after which, there being no
more wolves, the Welsh princes very logically concluded that
there ought to be no more tribute. In 1063, in consequence
of Duke Harold's successes in Wales, the tribute which had
been kept back several years was paid again. Bleddyn ap
Cynvyn, king of North Wales and Powis, who was
assassinated in 1073, a mode of death which may be considered
quite natural to the Welsh princes, did homage for his crown,
and acknowledged himself a tributary. He was a sovereign
who loved his people, and was beloved by them, and deemed
peace well purchased at the sacrifice of a precarious
independence. In 1079, William the Conqueror, under pretence  
  
  
  * Warrington, p. 146, &c.
<!-- Leaf 95, Page: 81 -->
ofa pilgrimage to the shrine of St. David, marched an army
into Wales; the native princes, awed by the terrors of his
name, submitted unresistingly to pay him homage, and take
the oath of fealty. The kings of England, it appears then,
were, by the acknowledgment of the Welsh princes, their
feudal lords, and all Wales was by these sovereigns regarded
as a fief of their crown held by suit and service. The
nonperformance of these duties entailed forfeiture, and gave the
superior lord a right to bestow the forfeited lands on others;
while, on the other hand, the withholding the protection to
whicli the vassals' were entitled broke the compact and set
the tenant free. Now as each party gave their own
interpretation to their respective rights and duties, it is very easy
to see how quarrels would begin, but not so easy to discover
where they were to end. As the tribute was never paid
voluntarily, and it was not always convenient to send an
army to collect it, we may be sure that the disposal of the
Welsh surplus could very rarely have proved a source of
embarrassment to a mediæval chancellor of the exchequer.
The first English adventurer who established himself in
Wales was Robert Fitz-Hammon,* a gentleman of the king's
privy chamber, and baron of the realm: in 1091, he, with
twelve knights and a large body of troops, landed in
Glamorganshire by invitation of Eineon, a chief of South Wales,
associated with Jestyn, lord of Glamorgan, both in arms
against Rhys ap Tewdwr, prince of South Wales. Jestyn
promised Eineon, if the enterprise succeeded, his daughter in
marriage. The enterprise was successful. Rhys, who was
above ninety years of age, took the field against these chiefs
and their auxiliaries, and fell in battle on the Black
Mountains near Brecon. The Normans, having received their pay,
departed honourably. Eineon lost no time in pressing Jestyn
to fulfil his promise, whicli, since the Normans had set sail,
Jestyn flatly refused. Now see the advantage of slow sailing:
the strangers were not so far on their way but that they
could see Eineon waving his mantle, which he did with all his
might; they returned, invaded the territories of and quickly
dispossessed the faithless Jestyn, and then proceeded to
divide his dominions according to feudal ideas. Fitzhammon  
  
  
  * Warrington, pp. 245-257.
e2
<!-- Leaf 96, Page: 82 -->
took the lion's share, and gave the rest of Glamorganshire, to
be held under him by suit and service, to his twelve knights,
leaving to Eineon the rough and barren mountains.
FitzHammon's good fortune very soon brought others on the
track: several barons petitioned the crown- for leave to
possess, under homage and fealty, the lands they might
conquer in Wales. The unpaid tribute gave the king of
England a plausible reason to grant their requests. Thus
Bernard de Newmarche took possession of Brecknockshire,
aud, to confirm his wrongfully-acquired authority, married
a Welsh woman of noble descent, Nest, granddaughter
of Gryffydh ap Llywelyn. Roger de Montgomery, earl
of Shrewsbury, did homage for Cardigan; Arnulph, his
younger son, for Dyvet, or Pembrokeshire. The Earl of
Shrewsbury did homage also for all Powis; Hugh Lupus,
earl of Chester, did homage for the country extending along
the sea-shore from Chester to the water of Conway; Ralph
Mortimer did the same for the territory of Eluel; Hugh de
Lacy for the lands of Ewyas; and Eustace Cruer for Mold
and Hopedale. Similarly numerous other fiefs were created.
At the beginning of the twelfth century a Flemish settlement
was formed in Pembrokeshire. The Flemings, under royal
patronage, had emigrated first to the north of England;
but, growing too numerous there, they were deported to the
wilds of Wales, whither they carried their quiet industrious
habits. Ros, the district principally allotted to them, is
held to have been the cradle of our woollen manufactory.
The kingdom of North Wales was at that time reduced to
the island of Anglesey, the counties of Merioneth and
Caernarvon, and a part of Denbighshire and Cardiganshire. This
summary will, I hope, tend to put the character of Llywelyn
in a fairer light, and enable us to appreciate better the really
noble part he played in the disordered times in which his lot
was cast.


Llywelyn ap Jorwerth was the grandson of Owain
Gwynedd, king of North Wales; his father, Jorwerth, the eldest
son of Owain, had on his father's death been unanimously set
aside, on account of a blemish in his face, which procured
him the nickname Drwyndwn, or broken-nosed. This poor
prince was forced at last, by the jealousy of the reigning
sovereign, to take sanctuary at Pennant Melangell in
<!-- Leaf 97, Page: 83 -->
Montgomeryshire, where he died. In the churchyard ofthe parish
there is a rude effigy of a man bearing a shield over his
breast, and the fragment ofa sword in his left hand, supposed
by Mr. Pennant to represent the hapless Jorwerth.* David,
Owain's eldest son by his second wife, ascended the throne,
and reigned twenty-four years. But the blemish of the elder
branch was, fortunately, not hereditary: Llywelyn, Jorwerth's
son, was a fine, high-spirited, handsome youth, very popular,
as he deserved to be, and, having his nose perfect, very soon
succeeded in putting his uncle David's nose out ofjoint, and
1194 by the voice of the people received the crown of North
Wales, which was his by right of primogeniture. Llywelyn
displayed no taste for making laws, but he had a great
constitutional idea, which he set his mind on carrying out.
Roderic the Great, as has been already stated, laid down the
principle that the kings of North Wales should be considered
as superior to the kings of South Wales and Powis, and
receive from them a certain tribute in acknowledgment of
inferiority, while the supremacy over all of the imperial
crown of London should be recognised by the payment of
tribute byr the kings of North Wales, or, as their full title ran,
Kings of All Wales, to the English sovereigns. To this
principle of subordination Llywelyn cordially subscribed; he
repeatedly acknowledged the supremacy of the kings of
England, and claimed from the princes of South Wales and
Powis, and the English barons who had settled in those
parts, equal homage as due to himself, their lord paramount,
with that which he paid to the king of England, his lord
paramount. Llywelyn, in the course of his long reign, saw
three kings successively wield the English sceptre: Richard I.,
John, and Henry III. In the reign of Richard I., which
was near its close on the accession of Llywelyn (the
lionhearted monarch died 1199), nothing remarkable occurred.
Shortly after John came to the throne, he sent Hubert de
Burgh to guard the Marches, as those parts of the country
were called which were in possession of English baron and
their tenants. About the same time, in 1201, a treaty of
peace was concluded between Llywelyn and the Earl of
Essex, justiciary of the realm: the treaty contained several  
  
  
  * Tour, vol. iii. p. 175.
<!-- Leaf 98, Page: 84 -->
articles, which may be found in my learned authority; first
and foremost, the King of North Wales " swore to maintain
perpetual fidelity to King John in the fulness of feudal
ideas."*


Availing himself of an interval of peace to assert his
rights, Llywelyn, in the year 1202, convened an assembly of
all the chieftains throughout Wales, who for the most part
appeared and took the oaths of allegiance to Llywelyn.
There was one potent recusant, Gwenwynwyn, lord of the
higher Powis, son and heir of the poet-prince Owain
Cyveilioc; he had a favourite idea of his own, to extend Wales to
its ancient limits, and was not inclined to pay homage where
his ambition had taught him to expect to receive it. He
neither came nor sent. The convention took the matter up
immediately, and voted a declaration that the Prince of
Powis ought to be compelled to the performance of his duty,
or forfeit his lands, as a part of the feudal obligation. To
this vote there was one dissentient, who was against measures
of compulsion, and he withdrew immediately after he had
given his vote. It was not long before Llywelyn appeared
in arms in the territories of the Prince of Powis; but
influential parties interfered (the names of those who did this
good office is not given), and the difference was settled
without bloodshed, the refractory prince making his
submission in due form. It does not speak much for the freedom
of opinion enjoyed at that time, nor for Llywelyn's placability,
that Elise, the only man who had the courage to speak his
mind, had his estates confiscated to the use and benefit of
the King of North Wales, as a penalty for his
straightforwardness, though he afterwards received a fragment of his
property back again. The sequel is curious : several years
after, in 1208, the Prince of Powis went to Shrewsbury to
confer with the lords of council; being there, he was
required to take to King John the same oath of fealty
which he had so reluctantly taken to Llywelyn, and detained
in custody till he complied, and had given hostages for his
obedience. Construing the visit of Gwenwynwyn to
Shrewsbury as an act of disloyalty to himself, and thinking it,
perhaps, a pity that the castles of the imprisoned chieftain  
  
  
  * Warrington, pp. 353-403.
<!-- Leaf 99, Page: 85 -->
should be without an occupant, Llywelyn went and took
possession of them himself, and when he departed,
considerately gave the Prince of Powis on his return an
opportunity to restock his farms, replenish his armoury, and
refurnish his mansions, as everything that was portable
Llywelyn took away with him. The King of North Wales,
to whom in 1204 King John of England had given his
daughter Joan in marriage, with a dower of the lordship of
Ellesmere, Shropshire, in the Marches of Wales, was called
to account for this outrage by his liege lord. He wrote
an explanation to the king at Bristol; his explanation was
accepted, a full pardon granted to him; and the year
following we find Llywelyn, in person or by proxy, doing homage
at Woodstock.


This same year the Earl of Chester made an inroad on
North Wales, and rebuilt the castle of Diganwy on the
Conway, which had been destroyed by Llywelyn. Llywelyn
scrupulously returned the" visit, and came home with as many
costly remembrances as he could well carry. The retaliation
of Llywelyn was represented to King John as an unprovoked
attack, and that rash monarch marched an army into Wales
to chastise his undutiful son-in-law on the spot; but this was
sooner said than done. John had not been in Wales long
before his principal anxiety was to get out of it. The country
people on the line of the march of the King of England had,
by command of Llywelyn, retired to the mountains of
Snowdon with their cattle and effects. The supplies to the hostile
camp were thus cut off; and though horse-flesh may be
agreeable for a change, it will not do for a constancy. His
pride stung to the quick, the King of England quitted Wales
with the wreck of his army. A few months afterwards he
returned with a larger force. Llywelyn's vassal princes, who
bowed the knee to him as their liege lord at his convention,
were all absent, or present where they should not have been,
—in the camp of the invader. He stood alone, and felt that
his sole resource was submission. Joan, his queen, mediated
successfully in his behalf. Under a safe conduct, Llywelyn
came into the presence ofthe King of England, and having
done homage, peace was granted to him on the following
hard conditions : that he should give forty horses and twenty
thousand cattle towards the expenses of the war, and cede
<!-- Leaf 100, Page: 86 -->
to the crown of England for ever the inland parts of his
dominions. Llywelyn's heart sank at this sad reverse.

But an unexpected event changed the current of his
thoughts, and revived his fondest hopes. In 1212 a nuncio
presented himself before Llywelyn, and in the name of the
sovereign pontiff, Pope Innocent III., absolved him from his
allegiance to King John, and gave him strict command,
under the penalty of excommunication, to molest and annoy
the King of England, with all his endeavours, as an open
enemy to the Church of God.* Llywelyn seized the
opportunity, and in 1213 held, for the second time, a convention,
which was numerously attended by the native chiefs. In an
eloquent and impassioned address Llywelyn urged them to
throw off a foreign yoke, and vindicate their ancient liberties
under the dominion of their own princes. The chieftains
responded to his appeal, and the plans of Llywelyn were
adopted and carried into execution with a promptitude that
displays the resolution of the man and the savage ferocity of
the times. For miles and miles the country round was
illuminated at night by the flames of castles and villages
throughout the whole of the English settlements,
intermingled with the territories of the Welsh confederate princes.
The rage of King John, when the news reached him, carried
him away to an act of barbarous and impolitic reprisal. So
soon as he reached the town of Nottingham, in the castle of
which were kept the Welsh hostages, twenty-eight youths,
some of tender age, belonging to the most distinguished
families in Wales, the king ordered the whole to be instantly
hanged, and would not break bread till the execution was
over. In the height of passion he vowed immediate
vengeance against the Welsh; but just as he was putting his
foot into the stirrup, to execute his threat, letters reached
him from different quarters, intimating the existence of a
formidable conspiracy, and that if he advanced it would be
to inevitable death. Alarmed at this intelligence, John
suddenly disbanded his army, and returned to London.

With his way clear before him, Llywelyn was nearer than
at any other time in his life the realization of his great idea
of uniting all Wales into one feudal kingdom, under himself as  
  
  
  * Powell's Caradoc, p. 234.
<!-- Leaf 101, Page: 87 -->
king. He was generally acknowledged lord paramount, and
two fortified places of great strength on the frontier, Diganwy
and Rhuddlan, that had been garrisoned by the English, fell
into his hands. The conscientious scruples, if they had any,
of the princes of South Wales, had been set at rest by the
Pope's absolution; but King John having made his submission
to the Holy See, the spiritual artillery that had been pointed
against the stiff-necked monarch was now at the service of
the meek and obedient vassal; and accordingly Llywelyn and
all his adherents were duly and formally excommunicated, for
the heinous wickedness — which the Pope had expressly
commanded— of making war on their liege lord. Now Llywelyn,
being a simple layman, could not be expected to be able
to follow very closely the turnings and windings of his ghostly
father; so I am not surprised to find that he quietly ignored
the Pope's excommunication, and proceeded with his great
national enterprise just as if nothing had occurred to interrupt
it. In 1215 he took the town and castle of Shrewsbury,
anciently Pengwern, the capital of the province of Powis,
and so within his rightful supremacy. About the same time,
as a stroke of policy, he gave his daughter in marriage to
Reginald de Bruce, an English baron of great influence in
South Wales. Then having reduced the castles in
Caermarthenshire and Cardiganshire, he returned home. Throughout
the whole of the expedition he had been accompanied by
the tributary princes and their retainers. Thus Llywelyn
won and wore the title that had been the day-dream of his
ambition, but had hitherto been only nominal,—King of All
Wales. Upon the death of King John and accession of
Henry III. Llywelyn found himself opposed to an antagonist
worthy of him, the great Earl of Pembroke; this
highminded man, guided by the purest patriotism, had composed
the differences between the revolted barons and their
sovereign, and proposed to include Llywelyn in the amnesty,
provided that he restored all the places he had seized in the
war. To the first summons to appear at Hereford, Llywelyn
paid no regard. But as the capture of Caerleon by the Earl
of Pembroke seemed to indicate an unfavourable turn in his
fortunes, in 1218 he complied with the second summons to
appear before the young king at Gloucester, and perform his
homage in the presence of the council and the Pope's legate.
<!-- Leaf 102, Page: 88 -->
By whatever cogent arguments induced,— wrought upon
perhaps by the ghostly admonitions of the Pope's
representative, Llywelyn, having been absolved by the legate, made a
full and absolute promise to restore all that had been taken
from the king's vassals in the late war, and went so far as
to say that all the nobility in Wales should do homage to
Henry as to their liege lord, and that whatever injuries the
king might receive, he would avenge them as if they had
been done to himself.


We have passed the culminating point in the fortunes of
Llywelyn. Throughout the remainder of his life he pursued,
with various success, the phantom of supreme power, the
substance of which he had been permitted once to grasp, and
had too early let go: still to the last he maintained the honour
and dignity of his name and nation, and in the civil wars
which harassed England through the protracted reign ofthe
virtuous but feeble Henry III.* whichever side had his
support felt nerved to the contest with a just confidence.
Llywelyn was not happy in his family. His eldest son,
Gryffydth, rose in arms against him, and expiated in a long
imprisonment the sin of filial disobedience. His wife, the
Princess Joan, daughter of King John, and who at a critical
period had given the strongest proof's of her fidelity and
affection, became the subject of an unfounded jealousy, whicli
wreaked its blind vengeance in the ignominious death of a
noble English prisoner, William de Bruce. That Llywelyn
repented of his unjust suspicions may be inferred from the
respect which he showed to her memory, by erecting over her
grave, as a tender memorial of his regard, a monastery of
bare-footed friars. Llywelyn, to whatever extent his mind
may have been perplexed, and his course of action impeded
by feudal obligations, had the interest and independence of
his country uppermost in his thoughts,—was, I shall not
hesitate to call him, a true-hearted Welshman. He died in
1240, having reigned forty-six years, and was buried by his
own desire in the Abbey of Conway, amidst the universal
regrets of his countrymen. By the Bards of his age, who


* It was a fine reply Llywelyn once made, when threatened with the
weight of the spiritual arm,—that " he regarded more the piety of King
Henry, and the alms he gave, than he did fear his power, or dread his
clergy."
<!-- Leaf 103, Page: 89 -->
could so perfectly enter into his feelings, he was idolized.
They sang his praises, and celebrated his victories, in the most
rapturous si rains. The following ode, written by Davydd
Benfras, in allusion probably to a defeat sustained by the
English army, commanded by Henry III., on the frontier, in
1228, is the translation, and upon excellent authority a very
faithful one, of a young poet of great promise, Maurice
Roberts of Llanrhudol, who died at the early age of
twentyone. The Bardic "awen" has not departed from, nor is the
fire of patriotism extinct in, a country which can boast such
a noble version as this,—composed when the author was
only seventeen.*  
  
  
  Creator of that glorious light
Which sheds around his vivid rays,
And the pale moon which rules the night,
O deign to animate my lays !
O may my verse like Merddin's flow,
And with poetic visions glow.
Great Aneurim, string my lyre,
Grant a portion of thy fire —
That fire which made thy verse record
Those chiefs who fell beneath the sword
On Cattraeth's bloody field.  
  
  
  0 may the muse her vigour bring,
While I Llywelyn's praises sing —
His country's strongest shield.
Ne'er was such a warrior seen,
With heart so brave, and gallant mien :
From a regal race descended,
Bravely he the land defended.
Kings have learnt his power to dread,
Kings have felt his arm and fled.
Loegria'sf king, with conquest flushed,
Boldly to the battle rushed;
Then was heard the warlike shout,
Signal of the approaching rout.  
  
  
  Great Llywelyn raged around,
Bravest chieftains pressed the ground;
None his valour could withstand,
None could stem his furious hand :
Like a whirlwind o'er the deep,
See him through their squadrons sweep.
Then was seen the crimson flood,
Then was Offa % bathed in blood,

  Then the Saxons fled with fright,
Then they felt the monarch's might.
Far is heard Llywelyn's name,
Resounded by the trump of fame.
Oft the hero chased his foes
Where Sabrina smoothly flows.
Could I poetic heights attain,
Yet still unequal were my strain
Thy wondrous deeds to grace.
E'en Taliesen, Bardic king,
Unequal were thy praise to sing,
Thy glories to retrace.
Long and happy may he live,
And his hours to pleasure give.
Ere his earthly course be sped,
And he lies numbered with the dead.
And ere upon his honoured tomb
Herbs shall rise and flowers shall bloom,
May the Redeemer intercede,  
  
  
  And unto God for mercy plead;
And when the judgment-day shall come,
And all attending wait their doom,
Then may Llywelyn, warrior brave,
In glory live beyond the grave.
O may the hero's sins be then forgiven,
And may he gain a seat with blessed saints in heaven.

The foundation ot' the British Churches, by the lapse of
time, the destruction of documents, the fewness and
indefiniteness of the notices in classical writers, is involved in
obscurity. Nor have the labours and researches of great
scholars thrown much light upon the question,—a result due
to their unhappy want of unity of purpose and motive; fruit
of those breaches of faith, and charity, and peace, against
which these essays are designed to be a continued protest.
In saying which, I hope that I approve myself, to the reader's
satisfaction, a good Protestant. Theologians and antiquaries
have approached the subject, less with a simple intention to
ascertain the real facts, than to establish or overthrow some
favourite or adverse theory. The battle of the Churches has
been fought on British ground, as stoutly and valiantly in the
first as in the nineteenth century. Hence it is that we have
many accounts, learned, logical, clever, convincing, yet so

opposite, as to leave his mind, who is bound to read them all,
in a state of very uncomfortable bewilderment, tending to
generate a feeling of distrust; of whicli, however, I will say
not one word more, for I would not for the world that the
reader should have so much as an idea what distrust is while
he is with me. Happily, I am not required to go into the
general question of the British Churches. My subject is a
single Church — a National Church, possessing her own
national records, of—pace, Doctor Giles, and most of our
English critics !—venerable antiquity. In adopting the
statements contained in these records, 1 feel that 1 am following
safe and trustworthy guides.*

In the eighteenth Triad we have three holy families :
the first, " the family of Bran the blessed, the son of Llyr
Llediaith; for Bran was the first who brought the faith of
Christ to this island from Rome, where he was in prison
through the treachery of Cartismandua." In the thirty-fifth
Triad we find " three blessed princes of the Isle of Britain :
first, Bran the blessed, son of Llyr Lledimth, who first
brought the faith of Christ to the Cambrians from Rome,
where he had been seven years, as a hostage for his son
Caradog, whom the Romans put in prison, after being betrayed
through the enticement, deceit, and plotting of
Cartismandua." The " Genealogy ofthe Saints ofthe Isle of Britain "
states that " Bran, the son of Llyr Llediaith, was the first of
the nation of the Cymry that embraced the faith in Christ."
Another copy,—"Bran was the first who brought the
Christian faith to this country." The preservation of these
remarkable facts is not at all surprising; the especial duty of
the Bards was to keep an authentic record respecting heroic
actions, and everything of superior excellence of country and
clan.f When it can be shown that there was any Greek or
Roman functionary charged in a similar manner with the
safe transmission of our great classical models, we will allow
them to stand on an equal footing; till that can be shown,
the Welsh Triads have the advantage. Caractacus and his
family came to Rome a.d. 51; therefore Bran, the father of
Caractacus, would have returned, bringing the glad tidings
of the Gospel, about 58. Now, it is rather a singularcoin* Ancient Welsh Laws, p. 382.  
  
  
  t Williams's Cymry, p. 55.
<!-- Leaf 107, Page: 93 -->
cidence that Bishop Stillingfleet, in his " Origines
Britannicæ," not knowing a word ofthe Triads, should have hit on
the very same channel for the introduction of Christianity
into Britain. " It is certain," writes this learned prelate (his
point is to prove that St. Paul preached in Britain), "that
St. Paul did make considerable converts at his coming to
Rome, which is the reason of his mentioning the saints in
Cæsar's household; and it is not improbable that some ofthe
British captives, carried over with Caractacus and his family,
might be some of them, who would certainly promote the
conversion of their country by St. Paul."* The deeply-read
and earnest-minded prelate, the late Bishop of St. David's,
Dr. Burgess, also trying to make out St. Paul to have been
the apostle of Britain, lays great stress " on two curious
British records, from which we may, in a great measure,
ascertain the time of St. Pauls journey to Britain." The
one is a rhetorical and cloudy passage in Gildas, which
seems to imply that the Gospel was preached in the British
isles at the latter part of the reign of Tiberius; the other is
the Triads which have been cited. " St. Paul was sent to
Rome, according to Eusebius, in the second year of Nero,
that is, a.d. 56; and he stayed there, according to St. Luke,
two years. Caractacus's family were sent to Rome in the
year 51, and stayed there seven years. St. Paul was sent
there in the year 56, and stayed two years. It is a
remarkable and a very interesting fact, that the detention of the
British hostages should have been coincident with St. Paul's
residence there as a prisoner; and it was a not less favourable
coincidence that they should be released from confinement in
the same year in which St. Paul was set at liberty. Nothing
could be more convenient for St. Paul's mission to the
Gentiles than the opportunity which their return must have
afforded him of introducing the Gospel into Britain, and
nothing more probable than that he should readily embrace
such an opportunity."f The "Genealogy ofthe Saints"
gives the names of four missionaries who accompanied Bran
on his return to his native country : Hid, Cyndav, and his
son Mawan, men of Israel; and Arwystli Hen, a man of Italy.

<!-- Leaf 108, Page: 94 -->
Arwystli is Welsh for Aristobulus. Now, in Romans, xvi. 10,
we read among the salutations, " Salute them which are of
Aristobulus' household." " In the Silurian Catalogue,"
writes the late lamented Professor Rice Rees, "Arwystli is
said to have been the confessor, or spiritual instructor, of
Bran. It is remarkable," continues this accurate and able
writer, who cannot be charged with any undue leaning to
national traditions, " that, according to the Greek Marty rology,
as cited by Archbishop Usher, Aristobulus was ordained by
St. Paul as a bishop for the Britons. Cressy also says, that
St. Aristobulus, a disciple of St. Peter or St. Paul at Rome,
was sent as an apostle to the Britons, and was the first bishop
in Britain; that he died at Glastonbury, a.d. 99; and that
his commemoration, or saint's-day, was kept in the Church
March 15."* " A farmhouse in Glamorganshire, called
Trevran, is pointed out by tradition as the place where Bran
used to reside. Not far from it is Llanilid, or the church of
Hid, which is regarded as the oldest church in Britain.
The wake, or festival ofthe parish, is still called Gwyl Geri,
from Ceri, it is supposed, the great-grandfather of Bran.
Such a coincidence of circumstances," Mr. Williams fairly
contends, " authorises us to form a strong conjecture as to
the particular locality where the first assembly of British
Christians met to worship their Lord and Saviour."-j- The
poet Martial addressed an epigram to the Roman Pudens,
and alluded to his marriage with Claudia, " sprung from
the azure Britons:" you remember that azure, or blue, was
the Bardic colour. This lady both Protestant and Roman
Catholic writers agree in thinking to have been a daughter of
Caractacus. He had another daughter, Eigan, who formed a
college of twelve religious persons, called after her own
name, Cor Eurgain. She was married to Sarllog, lord of
Caer Sarllog, the present old Sarum. Claudia and Pudens
are thought to have been the Christians ofthe same name
who joined with St. Paul in the salutations, 2 Timothy, iv. 21.

From the introduction of Christianity in 58 there is a lapse
of more than one hundred and twenty years, during which
we have no information about the Welsh Church. The

<!-- Leaf 109, Page: 95 -->
Romans the meanwhile had consolidated their conquests,
introduced their municipal government, civilization, and arts.
The treatment which we know Christians to have experienced
in other parts of the empire, we may fairly conclude them to
have experienced in Wales. Personally, they were very much
liked for their amiable and exemplary conduct; politically and
theologically, they were persecuted to the death. The next
visible link in our history is the correspondence between
King Lucius and Pope Eleutherius, of which the date is
variously assigned from 173 to 189. This monarch, whom
some will have to have been a myth hatched in the brain of
a dreaming anchorite, but whom I hold to have been real
flesh and blood, figures in the Triads as the second of the
sovereigns who conferred blessings. The first was Bran;
\"the second, Lleirvvg, the son of Coel, who was the son of
Cyllin, surnamed Lleuver Mawr, who made the first church
at Llandaff, and that was the first in the Isle of
Britain, and who bestowed the privilege of country, and nation,
and judgment, and validity of oath, upon those who should
be ofthe faith of Christ." Another Triad, speaking ofthe
three archbishoprics ofthe Isle of Britain, states, "The first
was Llandaff, of the gift of Lleirwg, the son of Coel, the son
of Cyllin, who first gave lands and civil privileges to such as
first embraced the faitii in Christ." The explanation which
Mr. Williams gives of the latter part of the Triads seeins to
imply that Bardism and Christianity had begun to clash, that
there was some jealousy displayed towards the Christian
ministers, and that what Lucius, with the consent ofa general
convention did, was to confirm the right of the teachers of
the Gospel to equal immunities with those enjoyed by the
ancient Druids, which were " five acres of land free;
exemption from personal attendance in war; permission to pass
unmolested from one district to another in time of war, as
well as peace; support and maintenance wherever they went;
exemption from land-tax; and a contribution from every
plough in the district in which they were the authorised
teachers."* By "validity of oath," the substitution of an
oath on the decalogue for the old Druid oath is meant.-)- We

f The old Christian form of oath in Wales was on the Ten
Commandments, the Gospel of St. John, and the Blessed Cross.
<!-- Leaf 110, Page: 96 -->
are hence to infer that Lucius, or Lleirwg, sent to consult the
Pope on the changes he meditated before he introduced
them; which was a very wise and prudent thing to do; and
that the Pope's reply was meant for the king's direction in
this matter. When it is said that Lleirwg made the first
Christian Church, we are to understand the first building for
Divine service, distinct from the Druidical circles, in which
the early British Christians worshipped. The Silurian
catalogue of saints states that four persons, Dyfan, Ffagan, Medwy,
and Elfan, were sent to Lleirwg by Pope Eleutherius.
Lucius, the classical version of Lleuver Mawr, " the great
light," is thought to have been a Welsh prince, whose
territories comprehended the present county of Monmouth and
part of Glamorganshire, and on whom the Roman emperors,
as their policy was, had conferred the title of King of the
Britons. There are in the neighbourhood of Llandaff four
churches, the names of which preserve the tradition of King
Lucius and his embassy; these are Lleirwg, Dyfan, Ffagan,
and Medwy.* Dyvan is considered to have been the first
bishop of Llandaff; and the church dedicated to his honour
marks out the place of his martyrdom. Ffagan is said to
have been his successor, of whom the Bards have sung,
\"Didst thou hear the saying of Ffagan, when he had produced
his argument? Where God is silent, it is not wise to
speak." f


Both Bran the first founder, and Lucius his worthy
successor, prove themselves to have been enlightened men by
the encouragement which they gave to literature, by helping
to make books more readable. The former introduced into
Britain the art of dressing skins as materials for writing, and
also of forming the cylinder or staff on which the parchment
was rolled up, thus superseding the wooden frame or
tokenslick of the Bards. J In the reign of Lucius the present style
of books was adopted with distinct leaves, one above another,
instead ofthe roll or volume.^


From 183, the conjectured era of King Lucius, to 303,
the date of the Diocletian persecution, the Welsh Church
{empty}.presents nothing remarkable. She had her bishops and

clergy, also her religious houses, in which the priests who
ministered in the surrounding districts resided in common.
We can name two sees in existence within this period,
Llandaff and Caerleon; the former claiming precedence as the
oldest, the latter as the most distinguished, being the
metropolis of the Roman province Britannia Secunda. We have,
not to speak of others, the famous Monastery of Bangor-Iscoed,
Flintshire, computed by Archbishop Usher to have been
founded in 182. " It is generally conceived," writes Mr.
Rowland, in his " Mona Antiqua," " that after the manner of the
Eastern Churches, there were seven bishops under the
archbishop in the province of Caerleon; and it is not unlikely
that the seven partitions or classes of clergymen, which
Venerable Bede mentions to have been in the renowned monastery
of Bangor, were so many distinct communities peculiarly
appertaining to those seven suffragan churches; whereof some
had bishops with seats endowed, and some had theirs
consecrated sine titulo." * King Moelmud, b c 440, had granted
right of sanctuary to several cities; these rights the Church
continued and maintained. The cross was venerated in
Britain from a very early period. The Welsh Church
honoured two martyrs who suffered in the persecution of
Diocletian, both citizens of Caerleon,—Julius and Aaron.
Two fine churches, with a convent of nuns, and a society of
regular canons, are by Giraldus Cambrensis said to have
been dedicated in their names, but neither was standing in
the twelfth century.f Britain under the government of
Constantius, who was opposed to all persecution, suffered lightly,
comparatively speaking, from the passing storm. At the
accession of Constantine, the Welsh Church enjoyed the
blessings of peace and security. It is asserted that no Welsh
bishops were present at the Council of Nice, 325, because
the Cymry did not acknowledge Constantine as their
sovereign, having transferred their allegiance to Eudav, prince of
Cornwall, who having fought hard to win his crown, wore it
fifty-four years. At the provincial Council of Aries, held
eleven years before (in 314), one of the subscribing prelates,
Adelfius, is thought with good reason to have been the
Archbishop of Caerleon. It is a question whether a Welsh

bishop was present at any of the councils held on the subject
of Ariauism.


The great event of the fifth century, in which the Welsh
Church was deeply interested, was the Pelagian controversy.
The opinions of Pelagius do not appear to have made any
great stir in the Welsh Church before their author left his
country, in 400. It was known that the monastery of
Bangor-Iscoed contained a remarkably clever monk, who lectured
admirably, and, of course, had a crowded audience; but his
peculiar views were put forward so cautiously, and were so
much in harmony with the sentiments of the leading clergy,
that they were not likely to have caused the sensation in
Wales which they did elsewhere. Neander* gives a very
full, and, upon the whole, a very fair account of the man and
his doctrines; but this great writer, in the estimate which he
forms, does not take into account local influences. The
Bardic principles inculcated liberty of will and moral progress,
which last idea the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews
favours, when he charges the disciples " to go on to
perfection." Pelagius, we may remark, was a great textuary.
His denial of original sin, assertion of free will, and belief in
the perfectibility of the Christian life, were quite in accordance
with the ideas of Bardism. Still he denied the doctrine of
the pre-existence of souls. " We do," he says, " condemn
those who say that souls have sinned in a former state, or
that they have lived in the celestial regions before they
were sent into bodies." With the views which he
entertained of man's nature, Pelagius unquestionably still held
fast to all the tenets taught in the Western Church respecting
the character and work of Christ. Being a man of a
remarkably strict and holy life himself, he beheld with grief and
indignation the laxity in which others indulged, and thinking
that he could trace it to the prevalent notions on the
corruption of human nature and the efficacy of the Sacraments,
Pelagius, like many zealous and good men, was carried to
the opposite extreme. He regarded " the corruption of
human nature " as an encouragement to moral indolence, and
as an excuse supplied to the hands of vicious men. On
1 Cor. x. 1, he says, " that no one might so rely on the fact  
  
  
  • Vol. iv. pp. 313-344.
<!-- Leaf 113, Page: 99 -->
of his having been baptized, or having partaken of the Holy
Supper, as to imagine that God would indulge him in
committing sin : the Apostle brings forward this example from
the Fathers, to show by it that those rites will indeed then be
truly profitable when the commandments are obeyed." To
use the Sacraments as charms, and to use them as appointed
means of grace, are very different things; and certainly the
Sacramental system, as worked at the present day, stands in
very favourable contrast to the working of that system in
the days of Pelagius. He really imagined that his
principles could be confined to the sphere of operation he assigned
them, but others saw clearly enough that they went far
beyond that,—that, in fact, they made the cross of Christ of
none effect; and hence the active, resolute, uncompromising
opposition that set in against them. " That doctrine
conquered which had on its side the voice of the universal
Christian consciousness, since this declared itself against the
Pelagian tendency; the doctrine conquered which found
a ready point of union in the whole life and experience of
the Church, as expressed in its prayers and in all its
liturgical forms."* It speaks well for education in Wales at
that period, as supplied by her monasteries; that Pelagius
was reputed one of the most learned men of his time,
superior even in that respect to his antagonist St. Augustine.
On leaving Wales, about 400, Pelagius went to Rome, where
he remained several years, and became acquainted with his
disciple, or colleague, Celestius; in 411 Pelagius is at
Carthage; in 415 in Palestine, where he encounters the honest
and erudite but hard-mouthed Jerome. Here an attempt is
made to condemn Pelagius by a synod, under the presidency
of John of Jerusalem. Among other accusations, he is
charged with controverting the doctrines of St. Augustine;
this the upright president will not hear of,—" What matter
is it to me what Augustine says?" Pelagius is acquitted.
The same year he appears before another synod at Diospolis,
in Cæsarea; but the reverend fathers are very reasonable,
they only require that grace and free will be both equally
maintained. Pelagius, to the charge of having asserted that
\"man if he pleases can be perfectly free from sin," explains  
  
  
  * Neander, vol. iv. p. 349.
<!-- Leaf 114, Page: 100 -->
by saying that " he who is converted from sin may live
without sin by his own efforts and God's grace, but that he
is not, for this reason, placed beyond the reach of temptation."
On being required to anathematise those who taught the
contrary, he replies, " I condemn them as fools, not as
heretics." The opponents of Pelagius appeal to Pope
Innocent, who, dying, leaves the cause to be decided by
Zozimus. This pontiff, misled by a plausible letter sent to
him by Pelagius, declares in his favour, and sends the
appellants a sharp reply,—" Would that some of you had
been present when the letter was read ! how rejoiced and
surprised were all the pious men who heard it I scarcely
could some refrain from tears, to find men so thoroughly
orthodox could yet be made objects of suspicion. Was
there a single passage in the letter where grace or the
Divine assistance was not mentioned?" However, upon
better information, Zozimus changed his mind, and ultimately
decided against Pelagius by an encyclical letter, published
418, in which he both condemned the doctrines and the
teachers, Pelagius and Celestius. Recusant bishops were
to be deprived and banished : a sentence carried rigorously
into execution. After this we hear no more of Pelagius.


In Chapter III. I viewed the Pelagian controversy in
Britain as a trial of strength between the Bardic and
Evangelical party in the British Church, and this seems
to have been the fact. The scales, which rank, power,
and influence had caused to incline to the Bardic side;
the opportune arrival, in 429, of the French bishops,
Germanus bishop of Auxerre, and Lupus bishop of Troyes,*
turned in favour of the popular cause. Germanus was
a native of Armorica, the inhabitants of which countiy and
the ancient Britons spoke a common language. So soon as
these good prelates came, they set to work in earnest; they
preached in the churches, fields, and highways, in which, not
excepting the first, it would seem that sermons had been
seldom heard before. Having thus felt their way they
proposed a public conference. I confess to an indifferent
opinion of platform discussions, where success attends
strength of nerve rather than sound reasoning. The scene of  
  
  
  * Williams's Cymry, pp. 102-105.
<!-- Leaf 115, Page: 101 -->
trial was thronged; the Pelagians c me in great pomp,
parade, and bravery of apparel. Their party spoke first, and
were received coldly, and heard with but little of the deference
to which they were accustomed; nor was their visible
mortification lessened by the cheers and shouts of applause that
interrupted the replies of their adversaries. From wounded
pride, or sheer incompetence, the Pelagians refused to address
the assembly a second time, and victory was by the popular
voice awarded to their opponents. The successful issue of a
battle fought shortly after, in which the Britons under
the direction of Germanus and Lupus repulsed some unknown
invaders, confirmed the judgment. The time happened to
be towards the close of the season of Lent; the bishops
were preaching, preparatory to the rite of baptism, in a
temporary church of interwoven branches of trees. The
British soldiers, in a holy confidence, attended unarmed. The
baptismal rites and paschal solemnities were just concluded
when the enemy advanced, emboldened by the unwarlike
occupations of the countrymen. Germanus placed himself at
the head of the British army, and took up his position in a
narrow mountain defile. So soon as the invaders had entered the
pass, the bishops shouted out " Alleluiah !" The soldiers took
up the cry, which echoed and re-echoed from rock to rock, and
threw the enemy into a complete panic : they flung down their
arms, fled, and left the Britons masters of the field. The site
of the battle is near Mold, Flintshire, at Maes Garmon; on
which, in 1736, Mr. Griffith of Rhual erected a
commemorative obelisk. The church of Llanarmon is supposed
to stand on the very spot where the wattled fabric was
constructed.* The changes introduced by King Beli were in a
former chapter represented as consequent on the defeat of the
Pelagian party. They may have been suggested by the
encyclical letter of Pope Zozimus. The effect of Beli's
edict, you may remember, was to throw the Christian ministry
open, and impose some check on the extravagance of Bardic
speculations. Pelagianism was weakened materially, but not
extinguished; the party revived in 447, and Germanus a
second time appeared in Wales as its antagonist. He
prevailed, and, by the consent of the people, the Valentinian  
  
  
  * Rees's Essay, p. 125.
<!-- Leaf 116, Page: 102 -->
edict was enforced, and the heads of the party banished. In
519* we again, and for the last time, find Pelagianism making
formidable advances. A synod was held at Brevi,
Cardiganshire, under Dubritius, archbishop of Caerleon; the Pelagians
having the best of the argument, or the best speakers,
Paulinus, a bishop, proposed that the monk David should be
summoned : the messengers found him in his cell and left him
there, for he would not come with them. At length
Dubritius in person went to beg his attendance; he came, and
conquered. This is our first introduction to the great Patron
Saint of Wales, in whose favour Dubritius having resigned,
he became primate of the Cambrian Church, and removed
the metropolitan see from Caerleon to Menevia.

Another interval of about eighty years brings us to the
arrival of St. Augustine. Pope Gregory the Great, on
sending Augustine into England, consecrated him under the
title of Bishop of the English. His commission ran thus,—
\"We commit to thee, our brother, all the bishops of the
provinces of Britain, that the unlearned be instructed, tl e
weak be strengthened by persuasion, the perverse be
corrected by authority: and thou, our brother, shalt have in
subjection, not only those bishops whom thou shalt ordain,
nor those only who shall have been ordained by the
Archbishop of York, but also all the clergy of Britain, by tho
authority of our Lord Jesus Christ."f With these credet
tials, about 600, St. Augustine crossed the Saxon frontier,
and presented himself in Britain, reduced to very narrow
limits, aud threatened with still further aggressions.
Augustine, coming from the court of Ethelbert, did not make his
appearance under the most favourable auspices; bent on the
benevolent scheme, of uniting the churches, he seems hardly
to have taken into sufficient consideration political relations.
He loved the Saxons as his own children, whom he had
begotten in the faith; in the eyes of the Britons they were
cruel and lawless invaders. The first conference between
the bishops and abbots of the British Church and Augustine
was held, as tradition runs, under an oak, called Augustine's
oak, at Ossentree, near Merton, Worcestershire, or at Aust
Ferry, Old Passage. The Apostle of the Saxons spoke first.  
  
  
  * Rees's Essay, p. 191.

<!-- Leaf 117, Page: 103 -->
He besought the British clergy to enter into a catholic
peace with himself, and undertake for their Lord the common
labour of preaching the Gospel to the heathen. He singled
out their observance of Easter at a different period from
the rest of the Western Church, and for the common benefit
entreated them to conform to established usage. This
Easter discrepancy is a great card with us, and far be it
from me to lessen its controversial value; but, as a question
of plain common sense, Rome was right, and the present use
of her computation, all the world over, proves it. To show
the immense inconvenience of a different computation, just
imagine that on the Surrey side of London, under the
shadow of Lambeth Palace, and the auspices of its pious
and amiable possessor, by way of a great anti-papal
demonstration, it were agreed that Easter should be
celebrated one week sooner than usual, to get the start of the
Pope; what a strange aspect to the spectator would the
opposite sides of the Thames present! Here all joy, there
all sorrow; funereal signs in one church, triumphal hymns
in another; sackcloth and ashes in Belgravia, mad
merriment on Greenwich Hill. St. Augustine touched also
on other points. Dunawd, abbot of Bangor-Iscoed, replied,
and there was reason in what he said, " That he did not
think it worthy to preach to that cruel people, who had
treacherousl}** slain their parents, and robbed them of their
just and legitimate property. He maintained, moreover,
that his countrymen owed spiritual subjection to none under
God beside the Archbishop of Caerleon." The old title
appears to have been kept up, though the see had been
removed to Menevia. The discussion lasted a long time.
Augustine terminated it by working a miracle on a blind
man, whom our Protestant writers, with a certain sly emphasis
which I do not pretend to understand, say that Augustine
brought with him. However, the Britons confessed that a
miracle had been wrought, and that Augustine was a preacher
of righteousness; but they could not, they said, renounce
their ancient customs without the consent and permission of
their countrymen. So another synod was held, at which
were present seven suffragan bishops to the see of Menevia
and Caerleon, the Bishops of Hereford, Llandaff, Llanbadarn,
Bangor, St. Asaph, Gloucester, and Margam, and many very
<!-- Leaf 118, Page: 104 -->
learned men, chiefly from the monastery of Bangor-Iscoed.
On their way to the place of meeting, the British clergy
bethought themselves to consult a certain holy and prudent
anchorite what they had best do. He answered, " If he be
a man of God, follow him." " Whence shall we prove this ? "
He replied, " By the test of humility. Contrive that he
come first with his friends to the place of the synod; and
if he shall rise when you approach, hearken to him obediently,
knowing that he is the servant of Christ: but if he shall
despise you, and be not willing to rise in your presence,
when you are more in number, then let him be despised by
you." They did as he told them. Augustine did not rise
to receive them. The synod opened angrily; the British
clergy would scarcely hear a word Augustine had to say;
at last he made to them an offer of unity, on three, or rather
four conditions,— first, general submission; secondly, the
celebration of Easter at the same time; thirdly, the
administration of baptism in the same manner with the Roman
Church; fourthly, to preach the word of God to the Saxons.
The British clergy would have willingly complied with the
last condition, so soon as they had seen any fruit come from
Augustine's sermons to the Saxons on the duty of the
restitution of stolen property; as it was, the proposals of St.
Augustine were clamorously rejected, and the synod broke
up, as it had opened, in heat and irritation. Augustine's
temper, which it must be admitted had been severely tried,
gave way, and he told the retiring fathers in a threatening
tone-—-the best of men have spoken unadvisedly with their
lips — that, "because they would not have peace with
brothers, they should have war with enemies; and since
they were unwilling to preach to the nation of the Angles
the way of life, by their hands they should suffer the
vengeance of death." A prophecy singularly accomplished,
by one of the coincidences belonging to the chapter of
chances, for the massacre that followed soon after of the
monks of Bangor was purely accidental. On the approach
of the heathen king Ethelfrith at the head of an army, the
community of Bangor-Iscoed left the monastery, and placed
themselves under the protection of Broehwell, prince of
Powis, who came to the field of battle, but, regarding the
protection of the monks as a sacred duty, remained at a safe
<!-- Leaf 119, Page: 105 -->
distance on the slope of a hill, which hid him from the sight
ofthe enemy. All would haye gone well, had not some of
the monks, in their patriotic ardour to watch the combat,
appeared on the top of the hill. The Saxon king saw them,
and on inquiry finding who they were, ordered his troops to
attack them; Broehwell, unprepared, gave way, and out of
twelve hundred religious, not more than fifty escaped. As
to calling a death like this a judgment, it is scarcely possible
to conceive any consummation of a holy life more glorious
than to fall invoking the blessing of Heaven on the national
arms, unsheathed in the cause of right and justice against
oppression and wrong. The monks of Bangor were
slaughtered, but enough stress is not laid on the instructive fact
that the Saxons were defeated,—they lost the day. Of the
two signs, the first, giving sight to the blind, was an evidence
of the presence of power; the second, refusing to rise, was
an evidence of the absence of humility. The second was as
good as the first, and, coming last, had the advantage. The
Pope, Augustine's sovereign, commanded him to go and
brills' the British Churches into communion; he went and
made the attempt, he could do no less. The British Church
stood on her rights, she could have done no less. Neither
side is to blame.


The repugnance of the British to the usages ofthe Saxon
Church continued unabated certainly to the close of the
seventh century; there is extant a letter, written in 692, by
Adhelni, afterwards Bishop of Sherborne, curiously
illustrative of the existing differences : the writer was at that time a
Saxon priest. " The priests of the Demetæ, or South-west
Wales, inhabiting beyond the bay of Severn, doe exceedingly
abhorr communion with us, insomuch that they will neither
joyn in prayer with us in the church, nor enter into society
with us at the table; yea, moreover, the fragments which we
leave after refection they will not touch, but cast them to be
devoured by doggs and unclean swine. The cupps also in
which we have drunk they will not make use of, till they
liave rubbed and cleansed them with sand or ashes. They
refuse all civil salutations, or to give us the kisse of pious
fraternity, contrary to the Apostle's precept, ' Salute one
another with a holy kisse.' They will not afford us water
and a towel for our hands, nor a vessell to wash our feet.  
  
  
  f 2
<!-- Leaf 120, Page: 106 -->
Whereas our Saviour having girt himself with a towell,
washed his disciples' feet, and left us a pattern to imitate,
saying, ' As I have done to you, so doe you to others.'
Moreover, if any of us who are Catholics doe goe amongst
them to make an abode, they will not vouchsafe to admitt us
to their fellowship till we be compelled to spend forty days in
pennance."*

In the ninth century, not before, the Welsh Church was
in full communion with the Church of Rome, with which,
even in Augustine's time, she does not appear to have had
any doctrinal differences. In the tenth century Rome had,
in the Welsh princes, very devoted children; as Howell thc
Good went twice to the eternal city to procure the papal
sanction to his code of laws. In the proceedings of the
courts of justice in Wales, these laws direct the judge to
put the debtor upon his oath, thus: " The judge must take
the sacred relic in his hand, and say to the debtor, ' The
protection of God be with thee, and the protection of the
Pope of Rome, and the protection of thy lord; do not swear
falsely.' "t Restricted as are the limits of this essay, I must
not leave unnoticed a circumstance that occurred in the
ninth century, most honourable to the Welsh Church. When
Alfred the Great had restored peace to his country, one of
his first acts was to invite three men of the highest
reputation for learning and ability, to give his newly-founded, or
resounded, University of Oxford a good start. Of these three,
the first was a monk of St. David's, no other than our
pleasant friend Geraint Bardd Glas, " the Blue Bard;" you would
not have guessed that there was a great man hidden in that
playful minstrel, singing his " Choice Things." In England
he bore the name of Asser, and died Bishop of Sherborne.

To him we owe a most interesting bit of biography,—
\"The Life of Alfred," which you will find in Mr. Bohn's
\"Six Chronicles." Asser there tells us a little about himself. J
\"In these times (about 880) I also came into Saxony, out of
the furthest coasts of Western Britain; and when I had
purposed to go to him (King Alfred) through many intervening
provinces, I arrived in the country of the Saxons, who live

on the right hand, which in Saxon is called Sussex, under
the guidance of some of that nation; and there I first saw
him in the royal vill, which is called Dene. [East Dean,
near Chichester]. He received me with kindness, and
among other familiar conversation, he asked me eagerly to
devote myself to his service, and become his friend; to leave
everything I possessed on the left, or western bank of the
Severn, and he promised that he would give me more than
an equivalent for it in his own dominions. I replied, that I
could not incautiously and rashly promise such things; for it
seemed to me unjust, that I should leave those sacred places
in which I had been bred, educated, and crowned (received
the tonsure), and at last ordained, for the sake of any earthly
honour and power, unless by compulsion. Upon this he
said, ' If you cannot accede to this, at least let me have your
service in part: spend six months of the year with me here,
and the other six in Britain.' To this I replied, I could
not even promise that, easily or hastily, without the advice
of my friends. At length, however, when I perceived that
he was anxious for my services, though I knew not why, I
promised him if my life were spared I would return to him
after six months, with such a reply as should be agreeable to
him, as well as advantageous to me and mine. With this
answer he was satisfied; and when I had given him a pledge
to return at the appointed time, on the fourth day we left him,
and returned on horseback towards our own country. After
our departure, a violent fever seized me in the city of
Winchester, where I lay for twelve months and one week, night
and day, without hope of recovery. At the appointed time,
therefore, I could not fulfil my promise of visiting him, and
he sent messenger's to hasten my journey, and to inquire the
cause of my delay. As I was unable to ride to him, I sent a
second messenger to tell him the cause of my delay, and
assure him that if I recovered from my infirmity I would
fulfil what I had promised. My complaint left me, and by
the advice and consent of all my friends, for the benefit of
that holy place, and al! who dwelt therein, I did as I had
promised to the king, and devoted myself to his service, or
the condition that I should remain with him six months ii.
every year, either continuously, if I could spend six month 1
with him at once, or.alternately three months in Britain and
<!-- Leaf 122, Page: 108 -->
three in Saxony; for my friends hoped that they should
sustain less tribulation and harm from King Hemeid (a prince
of South Wales), who often plundered that monastery and
the parish of St. Deguus (the diocese of St. David), and
sometimes expelled the prelates, as they expelled Archbishop
Novis, my relation, and myself, if in any manner I could
secure the notice and friendship of the king."

This evidence to the state of education in Wales in the
ninth century, may fairly be set against the printed evidence
of the state of education in Wales in the nineteenth century.
Remember, that when Wales gave Asser to Alfred she was
what she had made herself. When she helps to furnish
materials for a huge unsightly blue book, she is what we Saxons
have made her. With a mass of most interesting information
before me, which I cannot use, I feel as a poor man might in
feasting his eyes on piles of gold which he had no means of
carrying away. However, I have indicated where the
treasure lies, and I trust that others more able than myself will
seek and find it, and employ it for the common good.

It is my intention to devote this chapter to the
organisation of the ancient Welsh Church; the hierarchy, in the
order of tlieir rank, and such other interesting particulars as
I can find room for. The most ancient see in Wales, if
tradition can be depended on, and I see no reason why it should
not, is Llandaff, founded by King Lucius in 182. The
Triad, which contains the three archbishoprics ofthe Isle of
Britain, gives, "The first Llandaff, endowed by Lleirwg, son
of Coel, son of Cyllin, who first granted land and
constitutional privileges to the first Christians." The first archbishop
was Dyvan, the " proto-martyr of the Cambrian Church."
<!-- Leaf 124, Page: 110 -->
Merthyr Dyvan Church stands where he suffered. To him
succeeded Fagan, whom Pope Eleutherius, at the king's
request, sent to instruct this humble-minded prince more
perfectly in the way of righteousness. A blank follows to
the fifth century, and having nothing in the meanwhile to
say of Llandaff, we will turn to Caerleon.

This city was the seat ofthe Roman province Britannia
Secunda, and the see of an archbishop, who had under him,
as suffragans, several chorepiscopi, without any settled place
of residence. The names occur of Tudwal in
Caernarvonshire, Cynin at Llangynin, Gistlianus at Menevia, Paulinus
at Tygwyn, all of whom are called bishops.* About 447
Germanus and Lupus procured the appointment of a great
scholar, and very popular teacher, Dyfrig, or Dubritius, to
the see of Llandaff. Dyfrig was a grandson of Brychan, a
chief to whose honour the Triads record, " That he brought
up his children and grandchildren in learning and the liberal
arts, that they might be able to show the faith in Christ to the
nation ofthe Cymry wherever they were without the faith."f
Brychan had his quiver full; three wives in succession paid
the debt of nature, and left their living images in
twentyfour sons and twenty-five daughters. Dyfrig came through
the male line, and was worthy of his saintly progenitor. He
is said to have founded a college at Hennllan, near the Wye.
Hentland, in Erchenfield, is dedicated to St. Dubritius; and
there is within the district a farm, Llanfrother, on which ruins
may be traced.J Dyfrig from Llandaff was chosen
Archbishop of Caerleon, and held both bishoprics—I wish he had
not—twenty-two years, till the Synod ofBrevi. After which
he resigned his preferments, and retired to the Isle of
Bardsey, to spend the remainder of his life in solitary meditation
and prayer: an edifying example to pluralists present and to
come. St. David succeeded to Caerleon, whence he removed
the see to Menevia.


St. Teilo succeeded to Llandaff, the history of which we
will now follow, and on the death of St. David was nominated
to Menevia, in which he put his nephew Ismael as suffragan,
and continued at Llandaff with the title of archbishop. He

J Ibid. p. 172.
<!-- Leaf 125, Page: 111 -->
is commemorated as one of the three blessed visitors of the
Isle of Britain, Dewi (St. David) and Padarn being the
other two. " They were so called because they went as
guests to the houses of the noble, the plebeian, the native,
and the stranger, without accepting either fee or reward, or
victuals or drink; but what they did was to teach the faith
in Christ to every one without pay or thanks : besides, which,
they gave to the poor and needy gifts of their gold and silver,
their raiment and provisions."* Teilo had been out of
Wales seven years in the earlier part of his life. The
appearance ofa virulent pestilence had driven him to Armorica,
where he resided with Sampson, bishop of Dole. This
Sampson was himself a native of Glamorganshire, and, it is
said, returned to and died in Wales. In the churchyard of
Lantwit Major two large stone crosses still remain;f one
of them having three several inscriptions. The first
purporting that it was the cross of Iltutus and Sampson; the
second, that Sampson erected the cross for his soul; and the
third, that one Samuel was the carver. The other cross has
but one inscription, which states that it was prepared by
Sampson for his soul, and for the souls of Juthael the
king, and Arthmael. Oudocius, another nephew of St. Teilo,
and so much reverenced as to be ranked one of the patron
saints ofthe cathedral, succeeded his uncle at Llandaff; he


* Williams's Cymry, p. 133.

f The late Mr. Edward Williams (lolo Morganwg), the Bard of
Glamorgan, discovered one of these interesting memorials. I copy his
own account from Mr. Waring's recently published "Recollections and
Anecdotes" of the poet. I must premise that a tradition ran, that the
cross had once stood by the church porch, but had been undermined by a
newly-dug grave, and fallen in, and been covered with earth. " In the
year 1789," writes Mr. Wilhams, " being at work in Lantwit Church,
and being one day unable to go on with what I had in hand for want of
assistance, I employed a great part of one afternoon in digging in search
of this stone, and having discovered it, I cleared away all the earth about
it. Evening brought the farmers and their workmen home, and Mr.
Christopher Wilkins and the late Mr. David Jones (two very respectable
gentlemen farmers), on seeing this stone, ordered their men to assist me.
We with great difficulty got it out of the ground." Then follows the
inscription. " It lay on the ground, where it had been raised out of the
grave, till August 1793, when I procured assistance to erect it on the east
side of the porch, where it now stands. It must have been buried in the
ground before the continuator of Camden copied the inscriptions on
Iltutus, or otherwise he would certainly have copied this also."
<!-- Leaf 126, Page: 112 -->
is reported to have received consecration from St. Augustine,
but this is strenuously denied by Welsh Church writers.
Having faithfully fulfilled his part and ministry, he retired in
his old age to a monastery, which he had built upon the
banks of the Wye, where many brethren placed themselves
under his direction and instruction, for the religious houses
of those days were all places of education. Here Oudocius
remained many years, in great abstinence and sanctity, to his
dying day. The clergy of Llandaff stood on their rights, as
theirs was the most ancient archiepiscopal see, and disputed
jurisdiction, first with Caerleon, and afterwards with St.
David's. On one occasion this spirit of rivalry carried them
to very unjustifiable lengths, even to the compromise of
national independence; rather than pay obedience to St.
David's they chose to subject themselves to the English
primate. In 982 Gvvgan submitted to receive consecration
to the bishopric of Llandaff from the hands of Archbishop
Dunstan.*


In the eleventh century Llandaff had a very learned and
enlightened bishop, Bledri. He enjoined his clergy, in their
several churches, to instruct the people in learned books, that
everybody might know his duty towards God and man.
Bledri was consecrated 993, and died 1022.f His successor,
Joseph, forbad secular work on Sundays and holidays,
enjoined the priests to teach the reading of the Scriptures to
the people without money and without price, put the parish
festivals and wakes on a better system, to the promotion of
piety aud charity, and suppression of disorders and
irregularities. In 1108 Urban ascended the episcopal throne of
Llandaff, an active, energetic, munificent prelate; he found
the cathedral church in ruins, the revenues wasted and
alienated, and devoted himself heart and soul to the
restoration of the one and recovery of the other. The old cathedral,
erected, perhaps, by King Lucius, being only twenty-eight
feet long, fifteen wide, and twenty high, was judged too small
to receive the shrine of St. Dubritius, which Urban piouslv
designed to transfer thither. So he went and saw the
Pope at the Council of Rheims, 1119,-J; and procured from  
  
  
  * Williams's Cymry, p. 159. f Rees's South Wales, p. 622.
j Rees's South Wales, p. 623.
<!-- Leaf 127, Page: 113 -->
the Holy Father a brief addressed to the King, Archbishop of
Canterbury, and all good and charitable persons, lay and
secular, exhorting them to assist in the benevolent work of
rebuilding the cathedral of Llandaff. The subscription was
liberal, and Urban began his restorations, and carried them
on so far as the remaining fourteen years of his episcopate
allowed him. Mr. Conybeare* is of opinion, that traces of
Bishop Urban's work are to be found only in the present
presbytery. This good prelate had much of his time taken
up in journeys to and from Rome and the English court about
the recovery of lands, rightfully belonging to his see, which
had been seized by the Bishops of St. David and Hereford.
I am sorry to write this of those venerable personages. Bishops,
after all, are but men, and sometimes have itching fingers.
Bishop Nicholas ap Gwrgant died 1183. He was a good
Welshman, loved his country, and cared for the instruction
of the people. William Saltmarsh was bishop of the diocese
when Archbishop Baldwin visited Wales, in 1188, and is
called by Giraldus a discreet, good man. Synods were
held in Llandaff from the sixth to the tenth century.
They exhibit Church authority put to a noble use, in
enforcing spiritual censures against those whom the insolence
of power made regardless of human laws. In almost every
instance excommunication is inflicted on some royal offender.

In 519 the metropolitan see was removed from Caerleon
to Menevia by St. David. David, or Dewi, was great
grandson of Cunedda,a north-country chieftain, whoatthe beginning
of the fifth century sought an asylum in Wales, and whose
sons, a numerous progeny, expelled from their new country
the Irish marauders, and recovered a great part of South and
North Wales. This was about 420. The recovered lands the
sons of Cunedda divided among themselves, putting in a
claim in right of their grandmother, a Welsh heiress; but I
suspect that their trusty broadswords proved their best title.
Davids was noble both by father and mother; he was born
at New Menevia about 451, and brought up at Hen Meneu,
or Old Menevia. He received his education first in the school
of Iltutus, and afterwards in that of Paulinus, in the Isle of
Wight, where he is said to have spent ten years in the study  
  
  
  * Archæol. Camb., Jan. 1850. f Britannia Sancta, vol. i. p. 140.
<!-- Leaf 128, Page: 114 -->
of the Scriptures, having Teilo his fellow-student. St. David
is stated to have passed many years as a missionary in Britain,
visiting Glastonbury;*Bath, where by his blessings and prayers
those famed springs became as salutary as they are nauseous;
Devon and Cornwall, in which there are three churches of
which he is the patron saint; Leominster; R'agland; Gower,
in Glamorganshire: and resting from his labours in the vale
of Rosina near Menevia, his native place. Here he founded
or restored a monastery, of which and the surrounding
country he became quasi-bishop, if chorepiscopus will bear
that rendering. He gave to his monks a very strict rule.
\"He ordained that every monk should labour daily with his
hands for the common good of the monastery, according to
the word of the Apostle, ' That if any would not work
neither should he eat.' He would not suffer his religious to
receive any gifts (especially from wicked men), and in general
he taught them to love holy poverty and detest riches. They
used no oxen or other cattle to ease their labours, but tilled
the ground with their own hands. They had no speech
together but when necessity required it. During their work
they employed themselves in prayer, or in contemplation of
heavenly things. Having finished their work abroad in thc
fields (according to the time allotted them) they returned to
the monastery, and spent what time remained till the evening,
either in reading, or in writing, or in praying. In tho
evening they all went to the church, where they continued
in prayer till the stars appeared; and then took their meal
all together, eating sparingly and not to satiety. Their food
was bread with herbs or roots seasoned with salt; their drink
was a mixture of milk and water. After supper they
remained about three hours employed in watching, prayer,
and adoration, and then went to rest; they rose again at
cock-crowing, and continued at their prayers till the day.
All their inward temptations and thoughts they discovered
to their abbot or superior, and did nothing without asking
his leave and permission. Their habit or clothing was
of skins of beasts. Whosoever desired to join himself to
their holy society, was obliged to remain ten days at the door
ofthe monastery, acknowledging himself a wretched sinner,
and unworthy to be admitted amongst them; where he was
severely tried by rude words and rough usage, which if he
<!-- Leaf 129, Page: 115 -->
patiently endured all that time, he was then taken in by the
senior religious, who had the care of the gate, and was by
him instructed and exercised for a long time in painful
labours and grievous mortifications; and so, at length, was
admitted to the fellowship of the rest of the brethren, leaving
all his worldly substance behind him, of which the Community
would take no part." From this beloved retreat St. David
was most reluctantly drawn to appear at the Synod of Brevi,
where the learning, ability, and eloquence which he displayed
in defence of the true faith of the Gospel, so moved the aged
and failing Dubritius that he insisted on resigning his
archiepiscopal staff into hands better fitted than his own to grasp
it. St. David accepted, upon condition that the see should
be removed from Caerleon, then a busy, stirring city, to
Menevia, at that time, and at this, a solitude. Sir Richard
Hoare, reflecting on her days of splendour and abasement,
calls her " Once the British Loretto, now, alas ! the Palmyra
of Saxon antiquity."* But I am anticipating. In 529, St.
David presided at a synod convened at Caerleon, when the
canons ofthe Council of Brevi were confirmed and augmented,
and copies sent to most ofthe churches within the jurisdiction
of the archiepiscopate. The acts of this council formed the
rule and standard for the Welsh Church ever after. The
original canons were lost during the incursions of Danish
pirates, and it appears that there are no copies extant. St.
David did not disappoint the expectations formed of him; he
made in every respect an admirable prelate, and his praise
will last as long as the Church lasts. An ancient writer
informs us that the saint was " tall and handsome, with a
beautiful expression of countenance, a ready speaker, and
always to the purpose; and, in short, a most loveable person."t
The period of his death is variously given, it occurred most
probably about the middle of the sixth century.

The lives ofthe succeeding archbishops present nothing
very remarkable; and what little there is worth transcribing
occurs at distant intervals. In 910, Sampson was raised to
the chair of St. David, who, it is said, terrified by the
appearance of a fatal epidemic, fled to Dole, in Normandy, and
carried away the pall with him. I believe that there was  
  
  
  * Hoare's Giraldus, vol. ii. p. 22. f Ibid. vol. ii. p. 13.
<!-- Leaf 130, Page: 116 -->
such a bishop as Sampson, but I am satisfied that he is quite
innocent of making away with the pall. Between 980 and
1000 falls the Bishopric of Morgeneu.* Morgeneu was the
first Bishop of St. David's who ate flesh; his death by the
hands of Danish pirates was a judgment upon the sinful
indulgence. I say this, and I should not say it else, upon the best
authority possible—this gross-feeding bishop himself: He
appeared to a certain bishop in Ireland on the night of his
death, showing his wounds, and saying, " Because I ate meat
I am made meat." I commend this harrowing incident to
the vegetarians. In 1070, Sulien became bishop, who, after
two resignations and reappointments, the dates of which are
rather confused, died 1080, with the reputation of being the
wisest, most learned, and pious prelate in Wales. Sulien was
succeeded by his son Rythmarch; he died in the prime of
life, at forty-three: but though so soon removed, he had
acquired a brilliant reputation, not confined to his native
country, but extending to England, France, and Germany.
With the death of Rythmarch, in 1099, the education of
scholars ceased at St. David's. In 1115,t Bernard, a Norman,
chaplain to King Henry ]., and chancellor to the queen, was
forced upon the diocese by royal usurpation. A creature of
the English government, he paid the shameful price of his
nomination by submitting to receive consecration from the
Archbishop of Canterbury, to the prejudice of the just rights
ofthe Welsh National Church. Bernard began badly enough,
but the air of Wales braced his nerves; he plucked up a
spirit, and asserted his claims to metropolitan jurisdiction
against the Primate of England, but was obliged to yield at
last. The distinctions of meum and tuum were not clearly
apprehended in those times; the principle of men in power,
spiritual as well as secular, was, "get what you can, and keep
what you have got." So Bernard filched a large slice from
the diocese of Llandaff, which his successors hold to the
present day. Bernard died 1147. It would appear that the
Welsh clergy had not acquiesced in the unconstitutional
interference of King Henry I., but had chosen a rightful bishop,
as, within the episcopate of Bernard, occurs an entry in
Caradoc's History, translated by Doctor Powell:%—" Towards the  
  
  
  * Rees's South Wales, p. 848. f Williams's Cymry, p. 163.
% P. 155.
<!-- Leaf 131, Page: 117 -->
end ofthe same year (1124) died Daniel ap Sulien, bishop
of St. David's and archdeacon of Powis, a man of
extraordinary piety and learning, and one who made it his
continual employment to endeavour to work a reconciliation
betwixt North Wales and Powis, which in his time were at
perpetual variance and enmity with one another." David
Fitzgerald, of English extraction, succeeded Bernard in 1147.
At the death of the latter, the National party made a strong
but ineffectual effort to procure the election of a real
Welshman; but this hybrid prelate was a modest, quiet, contented
man, who made the most he could of his own, and never
coveted other men's goods. He was a kind friend to his
diocese, and after the heats occasioned by his appointment
were over, was much and deservedly respected. He was the
uncle and protector of Giraldus Cambrensis. Fitzgerald
dying 1176, the chapter elected Giraldus, but King Henry II.
refused to confirm him; Peter de Leia, a Cluniac monk, and
prior of Wenlock, stepped in. Giraldus, not quite an
unprejudiced authority, accuses Peter of too frequent and too
long absences from his diocese, and of levying heavy
contributions on his clergy : if, however, he was away in the body,
he was present in the spirit, and put the money to an
excellent use; as in his archiepiscopate the ancient cathedra],
which had been greatly damaged by the incursions of pirates,
was pulled down and rebuilt. This is the date of the oldest
portion ofthe present magnificent ruin.* The translation of
the metropolitan see from Caerleon to St. David's was not
well advised. " Caerleon," writes Giraldus, " was much better
adapted for the episcopal see; for Menevia is situated in a most
remote corner of land upon the Irish Ocean, the soil stony
and barren, neither clothed with woods, distinguished by
rivers, nor adorned by meadows, ever exposed to the winds
and tempests, and continually subject to the hostile attacks
of the Flemings on one side, and of the Welsh on the
other."-)*


These were not the worst evils. The unscrupulous
ambition and insatiable spirit of aggrandisement displayed by
the kings of England, were the most formidable antagonists
to the metropolitan rights and independence of thearchiepi* Hoare's Giraldus, vol ii. p. 20. f Ibid. vol. ii. pp. 1, 2.
<!-- Leaf 132, Page: 118 -->
scopate of St. David's. In the early part of the twelfth
century, the English had gained a firm footing in South Wales.
The diocese of St. David's fell within the Saxon lines. A
century and a half before the final conquest of Wales, we
have Henry I. interfering in the election of an archbishop,
and depriving the chapter of their just rights. The sanctity
which invested the memory of her great saint, and drew so
many thousand bare-footed pilgrims to his shrine—two visits
to St. David's being equal, in spiritual arithmetic, to one visit
to Rome—had its inconveniences. There were many who
came in sincere, but not a few in simulated piety. When, in
1079, William the Conqueror made a pilgrimage to the shrine
of St. David, it was not pure reverence that carried him
thither. This pretext gave a safe passage to himself and
army; but he did not return without exacting homage from
the kings and princes ofthe land. We do not give Henry II.
credit for any better motives in the visit which he, in 1171,
habited as a pilgrim, and leaning on a staff, paid to the shrine
of St. David. Upon no recognised church principle ought
the Cambrian to have been subject to the English
archbishopric; the former was the older see by more than one
hundred years, and had always, since the removal to
Caerleon, claimed metropolitan jurisdiction. With as much
reason, in the United Churches of England and Ireland, might
the Metropolitan of Armagh and Primate be made a
suffragan of the Archbishop of Canterbury, as in the United
Churches of England and Wales the Metropolitan of St.
David's be reduced to that unworthy and unjust subjection.
Time has not weakened the force of the indignant words of
Giraldus : " With respect to the two sees of Canterbury and
St. David's, I will briefly explain my opinion of their present
state. On one side you will see royal favour, affluence of
riches, numerous and opulent suffragan bishops, great
abundance of learned men, and well skilled in the laws; on the
other side, a deficiency of all these things, and a total
privation of justice, on which account the recovery of its ancient
rights will not easily be effected, but by means of those great
changes and vicissitudes which kingdoms experience from
various and unexpected events."*

<!-- Leaf 133, Page: 119 -->

We must now turn our steps to North Wales. About the
middle ofthe sixth century, Deiniol, a Welsh saint, founded
a monastery in Caernarvonshire, which he called Bangor,* or
the High Choir. Maelgwn Gwynedd, king of North Wales,
raised the monastery to the rank of a bishopric, and Deiniol,
or Daniel, became the first bishop. He is said to have been
a Bard, though none of his poems are extant. In his old
age he retired to the Isle of Bardsey, where he died and was
buried. In 755, Elbodius was chosen Bishop of Bangor; in
virtue of the titular supremacy of the kings of North Wales,
he assumed the title of archbishop, and tried to bring his
brother-prelates in South Wales to acknowledge him as
metropolitan : but spiritual claims, resting on a purely secular
basis, are not of much account, so the pretensions of Elbodius
went for nothing. This ambitious prelate, however, was a
very sensible man, and succeeded in persuading the
inhabitants of North Wales to adopt the Roman computation of
Easter. South Wales stood by the old reckoning till 777,
when, through the influence of Elbodius, the Roman
computation was introduced there also. Matters so remained till the
death of Elbodius in 809, when the controversy was revived,
"for the Bishops of Llandaff and St. David's would not
submit to the Archbishop of North Wales, when they were
themselves archbishops in their own right."f The Easter
question was not fully settled so late as the middle of the
ninth century.! " Certain clergymen, who dwelt in the isles
ofthe ocean, came to Constantinople in the days of Methodius,
from 842 to 847, to inquire of certain ecclesiastical traditions,
and the perfect and exact computation of Easter." The
successors of Elbodius were content with the title of bishop.
No event of general interest is associated with their names;
Bishop Mordaf, in the tenth century, went in the train of
Howell the Good to Rome. Urban, bishop of Llandaff, it is
said, held Bangor while his own cathedral was being rebuilt,
and resigned on its completion. In 1190, Giraldus,
archdeacon of Brecknock, was chosen bishop, but refused to
accept the see, having set his heart on St. David's, which he

<!-- Leaf 134, Page: 120 -->
never got; and so between two or rather three stools, for
he was offered St. Asaph also, died plain archdeacon. But
I am anticipating. The cathedral of Bangor was destroyed
by the Saxons in 1071, and afterwards rebuilt; but the
edifice of the twelfth century is not the edifice of the present
century, so I need say nothing about it.

The fourth and last of existing bishoprics is that of
St. Asaph. The north has continually infused new blood
into the south; Cumberland gave poets to Wales, and
Scotland saints, though both after a somewhat rough fashion.
St. Kentigern, grandson of Urien Rheged, with whose name
the reader is acquainted, in the early part of the sixth
century was raised to the see of Glasgow. He was a very good
man, so much so as to be called Mwyngu, "amiable," clipped
into Mungo. Being so delightful and excellent a person, he
was the subject of persecution, as most sincere Christians are,
and, driven from Glasgow, took refuge in Wales, where he
received a hearty welcome from St. David at Menevia, who
recommended him to the protection of Cathwallain, uncle to
Maelgwn Gwynedd, king of North Wales, who, at his own
request, gave him a beautiful site between two rivers, on
which he built a church called Llanelwy. Why Kentigern
asked for this particular spot is thus explained: — The good
saint was looking carefully over the ground to find the best
situation for his projected building, when a milk-white boar
came out of the woods and stood right before him. The animal
shook his head, then went on a little way, then looked back,
as much as to say, Follow me. St. Kentigern followed the
beautiful boar. When he came to a certain place, where
a river ran on either side, the boar stood still, stamped his
foot on the ground, dug up a turf with his tusk, shook his
head again tremendously, and gave an awful grunt. This
set the difficulty at rest. The milk-white boar departed,
and Kentigern, by permission of his royal patron, founded his
church on the very spot so marvellously indicated.*

After he had built his church, St. Kentigern added a
monastery, which he put under an excellent system that did
credit to his Scotch head and heart. He distributed among
his monks —there were a thousand—"according to theirdif* Hoare's Giraldus, vol. ii. p. 145.
<!-- Leaf 135, Page: 121 -->
serent capacities and dispositions, the functions of the active
and contemplative life, some were employed in tilling the
ground, tending the cattle, and such-like offices, for the
service of the community; others in works of charity and
hospitality for the relief and assistance of their neighbours; others
were wholly given to the study ofthe Holy Scriptures, divine
meditation, and praises, amongst whom he so divided the
twenty-four hours of the day and night that the divine office
was never discontinued in the church, but some part of them
were at every hour singing the praises of God; out of these,
again, he made choice of several of the best qualified to
preach the word of God, and to assist him in his apostolic
labours."* He had conducted a monastery at Glasgow on
the same principles, and sent missionaries thence to Great
Britain, the Orkney islands, and even to Norway and Iceland.
St. Kentigern was almost always on foot, he would travel no
other way, preaching, baptizing, and building; he never saw
a place which wanted a church that he could rest till he had
put one there. " The austerity of his life was," we are told,
\"admirable;" certainly it was much more to be admired than
imitated. " It was usual with him to eat but once in three or
four days,"—the worthy biographer means eating a belly-full,
the Saint must have had something every day, — "and then
his food was only bread and milk, or cheese and butter, for
he wholly abstained from flesh, wine, and all strong drink; he
always wore next to his body a rough hair-shirt; his habit
was a garment made of goat-skin; his bed a kind of stone
coffin, strewed with ashes, over which he spread a hair cloth,
and had a stone for his pillow; after a short sleep, he usually
rose in the night, and going into cold water, there sang all
the one hundred and fifty Psalms to the praise of his Maker."
Such was the turn evangelical religion took in those days.
I am afraid that there are not many whose devotion ranges
at so high a temperature as to bear to have cold water thus
thrown upon it. Under the auspices of Maelgwn Gwynnedd,
who from an enemy turned to a fast friend, St. Kentigern's
monastery became the seat of a bishop's see. He lived in
Wales many ye?rs, till his old flock returned to a better
mind, and prayed to have him again; so he went back to  
  
  
  * Britannia Sancta, vol. i. p. 36.  
  
  
  G
<!-- Leaf 136, Page: 122 -->
Glasgow, where his name is still held in honour. Before he
departed he chose a successor, St. Asaph, who had had the
management of the house during St. Kentigern's frequent
absences on his missions, and in whom he placed full
confidence.


St. Asaph was of noble family, and as remarkable for the
graces of his person as of his mind and heart. The people
loved him so much, that, to keep him always in mind, they
changed the name of the see from Llanelwy to St. Asaph.
He was a constant and faithful preacher, and had one great
saying, " They who oppose the preaching of God's word,
envy the salvation of men."* He died May 1, 596. From
the death of Asaph in 596, to the consecration of Gilbert in
1143, only one name ofa bishop of this diocese occurs, and
that is questioned—Chebar, who attended Howell the Good
when he went to Rome. It is assumed that there was no
episcopal succession kept up. But I am much more willing
to believe records to have been wanting, which might easily
be through the troubles of the times, than the Welsh Church
to have been wanting, by leaving the see vacant five hundred
years and more.


Gilbert was followed, in 1151, by Geoffry, archdeacon of
Monmouth, the standard historian of Britain during many
centuries, whom devout generations swore by, and indevout
critics swear at. It has been proved, however, that he did not
invent, he only freely translated, an ancient British book put
into his h^nds by Walter, archdeacon of Oxford. Geoffry
was a pluralist: he held the abbey of Abingdon, in England,
i?i commendam with the Bishopric of Asaph, and had the
misfortune to lose both. At a council held in London, 1175,
Geoffry was presented by the clergy of his diocese for
nonresidence, and sooner than go into residence he resigned.
He expected to have kept Abingdon, but at the complaint of
his monks was turned out of his abbey. Geoffry was not
popular personally, either in WTales or England; with all his
learning he had not learnt to be generous, and by an absence
of mind perhaps venial in an author, he seems to have read
one of our Lord's Beatitudes backwards. The rule of
Geoffry's life was said to have been that " it is more blessed  
  
  
  * Willis's St. Asaph, vol. i. p. 39.
<!-- Leaf 137, Page: 123 -->
to receive than to give." Geoffry, when bishop, sided with
King Henry II. against Thomas a Becket, and it is hinted
that the Archbishop's influence, when his turn came round,
told against Geoffry. Our author retired to London after the
loss of his preferments, and still hung about the court, and
is supposed to have died towards the end of the twelfth
century. The literary autocrats of the present make slashing
work with the reputation of past authorities; who knows, but
some hundred or two years hence an Aristarchus may arise,
who shall give a mortal stab to the genius of Macaulay, and
consign his facts to the same limbo with those of the
exBishop of St. Asaph?

In 1186 Reyner was consecrated by Baldwin, archbishop
of Canterbury. When Baldwin came into Wales, Bishop
Reyrner " accompanied him through his diocese, and used his
endeavours to persuade many to take the Cross upon them,
and fight against the Saracens; which, as Baldwin subtly gave
out, was the chief end of his progress: whereas the true
occasion seems rather to have been to bring the Welsh clergy
under subjection to the see of Canterbury, in opposition to
the see of St. David." * The cathedral of St. Asaph has been
more than once burnt to the ground, and rebuilt; the present
church was not standing in the twelfth century, therefore
I am silent about it.


In addition to the four existing bishoprics, St. David's,
Llandaff, Bangor, and St. Asaph, there were two others.
Llanbadarn.-f- north of the diocese of St. David, supposed to
have included a considerable part of Montgomeryshire: it is
spoken of in the Welsh Chronicles as having been ravaged
by the Saxons in 720. Tradition runs that the last bishop
was killed in a sedition, and no successor presenting himself
the see was annexed to St. David's. The other extinct
bishopric was Margam,*]; founded by Morgan king of
Glamorganshire in the sixth century; a succession is given of
nine bishops ending with Cyvelach, slain in battle in 756, when
the see was incorporated with that of Llandaff.

The Welsh parish churches, according to the theory of
Professor Rees,§ were at first few, and the districts assigned

to them extensive. In process of time, as more church
accommodation was required, chapels of ease were built,
served by curates appointed by the incumbent of the mother
church. To these chapels of ease, districts were afterwards
assigned. The minister of the district became a perpetual
curate; his stipend was paid either out of the tithes of his
district or in money by the incumbent of the parish church.
These are said to be parishes of the oldest foundation in
Wales. The district of Nantmel, Radnorshire, is given as
an instance, which includes the several parishes, Nantmel,
Llanfihangel, Llanyre, and Rhayader. Nantmel is a vicarage
in the patronage of the Bishop of St. David's, Llanfihangel
and Rhayader are perpetual curacies in the gift ofthe vicar
of Nantmel, and the chapelry of Llanyre is vested in the
vicar himself. There are also numerous small rectories,
which are principally found in the southern part of
Pembrokeshire, in the vale of Glamorgan, and on the borders of
England; these were founded by the Normans and Flemings,
who thought a church spire or tower a great ornament to
their demesnes, and liked to have a minister of God near
them. Besides churches and chapels, there were a great
many cells, oratories, and hermitages, very few of which are
now left. The prefix " llan " was first applied to churches
and chapels generally, " capel" to chapels of ease and
oratories, " betwys " to chapels, and benefices of late
foundation. Sometimes capel and betwys are put together, as
Capel Betwys Lleicu, Cardiganshire.

The saints to whom the greatest number of churches are
dedicated are St. Mary the Virgin, St. Michael, and St.
David. The churches dedicated to St. Mary are most
numerous in the English and Flemish possessions. Churches
in honour of St. Mary were erected principally in the twelfth
century, by the influence of the Cistercians,* the most
prevalent order in Wales, who have an especial devotion to the
Blessed Lady. St. Michael was a great favourite in Wales;
the churches dedicated to him are stated to have been built
during the first half of the ninth century. There are forty
churches and thirteen chapels dedicated to St. David, and of
them not one in North Wales. In the original diocese of  
  
  
  * Williams's Cymry, p. 185.
<!-- Leaf 139, Page: 125 -->
Llandaff he has but two chapels, and only three in what is
supposed to have been the original diocese of Llanbadarn :
all the rest, including every one of the endowments, are in
the district of which, as Archbishop of Caerleon or Menevia, he
was himself the diocesan. The cathedral of St. David's is in
the territory of his maternal grandfather; the neighbourhood
of Henfynyw appears to have been the property of his father;
and Llanddevvi Brefi is situated on the spot where he silenced
the Pelagians.

The Liturgy of the ancient Welsh Church is not in
existence. Mr. Williams* endeavours to make out that it
was identical with the " Great Oriental Liturgy," and
derived from Ephesus. The Liturgy of St. Mark is said to
have been brought by Germanus into Britain, and chanted
by Padrig in his own collegiate church. From ancient
writings in the Welsh language, something may be gleaned
of the spirit at least of the Cambrian offices. Here is a
prayer composed by Talhaiarn, chaplain to King Erurys:—
"God, grant thy protection, and in thy protection strength,
and in strength discretion, and in discretion justice, and in
justice love, and in love to love God, and in loving God to
love all things." " It was a usual saying of Beuno, who
lived in the sixth century, ' Chaunt thy Pater Noster aud
thy Creed.' So au early Bard, ' I enquired ofall the priests,
the bishops, and judges, what is most profitable for the soul.
Food [for the needy], the Pater Noster and the Blessed
Creed; whoever will chant these for his soul, until the
judgment will do the very best thing.' We learn from the
laws of Howell the Good that it was usual, in the tenth
century, to chant the Lord's Prayer for the souls of all
Christians at the gate of the churchyard. It was also
chanted at the church-door, before the figure of the cross."
Upon church-bells there is enough to fill a book, and a
very amusing book has been written, I believe, lately on the
subject. In the Welsh Church it was the custom to use
portable hand-bells. The principal services of the Church
were morning and evening. There were candles on the
altar it is inferred from a passage in an old Welsh law:—
\"Bees derive their origin from paradise, and because of the  
  
  
  * Williams's Cymry, chap. xvii.
<!-- Leaf 140, Page: 126 -->
sin of man did they come from thence, and God conferred
on them his blessing, and therefore mass cannot be chanted
without their wax."* The Holy Eucharist was administered
to the sick and dying. According to the Welsh laws, " Any
one might take the first horse that offered itself, in order
to send for the priest, lest the sick man should die without
communion."f The Holy Scriptures were, in the sixth
century, familiar to the educated; the writings of Gildas are
full of allusions to them. Proverbial sayings indicated that
the people also knew and appreciated the Bible : " The word
of God above all. There is no word superior to every word,
but the word of God." Among the homiletical remains of
the Welsh Church we find this tradition : " The three advices
given by Lazarus are, ' Believe in God who made thee, love
God who redeemed thee, and fear God who will judge
thee.'" %

In the early ages of the Church, Christians under the
pressure of general or local persecution fled to desert and
mountain tracts, where nature, more generous than man,
gave them a shelter and a home. The Spirit of the Gospel,
mighty to save in every condition of life, sustained and
cheered them. Was their pilgrimage to the everlasting hills ?
<!-- Leaf 142, Page: 128 -->
"Jesus went up into a mountain, and continued there apart.
Did unaccustomed privations try them ? it was but taking
up their cross to follow Him. Wales, remote and
comparatively inaccessible, invited these unhappy fugitives for
conscience sake, and numbers flocked thither. There was
scarce a cave in the sea-cliffs fashioned by the
tempestuous waves — scarce the shadow of a great rock in a
weary land—scarce an isle, else untrodden by foot of man
or beast, that had not for its contented dweller some holy
anchorite, whose memory long lingered there, and made
each barren spot fruitful in good thoughts and profitable
meditations. When systematic persecution ceased, this
ascetic spirit survived. On the decline of the Roman
empire, and consequent abandonment of Britain, this spirit
found, unhappily, too much to feed on, during the
calamities of the times, when horde after horde of pagan
barbarians swept the face ofthe earth, and in their impious rage
laid the sanctuaries of religion, the beautiful houses of
God, low, even to the dust.


In the fifth century, Talhaiarn, of the line of Coel, a
celebrated Bard, and saint ot' the congri'gation of Cattwg, and
who composed the prayer cited in the last chapter, after his
king and master (Ambrosius, king of Britain) had been slain
in battle, lived many years as a hermit at a place since called
Llanfair Talhaiarn, Denbighshire.* In the same century, we
have an aged king of Glamorgan, Tewdrig, commemorated
in the Triads as one ofthe three canonical kings, who resigned
his crown to his son Meurig, himself a great benefactor to
the Welsh Church, and retired to lead a religious life in the
solitude of Tintern. A Saxon invasion forced him from
his seclusion, to head his people against the armies of the
aliens. In the battle, the old king was mortally wounded.
His dying prayer bespoke the warrior-saint,—that a church
might be erected on the spot where he breathed his last.
The church was built, and called Merthyr Tewdrig, now
Mathern.f

There is on the southern coast of Pembrokeshire,! not
far from Stackpool Court, a chapel, in a wild, rocky ravine,  
  
  
  * Rees's Essay, p. 168. -f- Ibid. p. 184.

J Fenton's Pembrokeshire, pp. 414-416.
<!-- Leaf 143, Page: 129 -->
descending to the sea-shore: the chapel is called St. Govan's
hermitage. Who St. Govan was, whence he came, where
he lived, and what he did, are unknown. The sacred
building is a rude structure, twenty feet by twelve : height not
given. It contains a raised altar, under which the body of
the saint is believed to repose : to the right of the altar is a
niche for holy water; to the left an arched doorway, opening
into a curious recess, just the size and shape of a man of
ordinary stature in a crouching posture. Whether, as
tradition goes, that singular hiding-place opened of itself to
receive the saint, pursued by his enemies, or whether the
saint, to fill up his time, opened it himself, I cannot tell;
there it is, visit it and judge. On the north side of the
chapel, on the floor, there is a little spring, the not very
clear water of which is held to be a sovereign remedy for
diseases of the eyes. Shame upon them for the sacrilege !
Some pirates stole the chapel-bell, which was very heavy,
so that they were obliged to set it down half-a-dozen times
before they got to their boat. The stones on which the bell
so miraculously rested contracted instantly the virtues of
bell-metal, and have not lost them yet. St. Govan's
hermitage is situate in one of the wildest and most romantic
spots of the coast scenery in Pembrokeshire, and is decidedly
worth visiting—so says Sir R. C. Hoare—were it only to see
the cliffs; sublimer than which, he says, are nowhere to be
found.


Connected with the church of Pennant Melangel,
Montgomeryshire, there is a beautiful legend of a virgin solitary.
On a certain day in the year of grace 604, Broehwell, prince
of Powis, went out to hunt. The hounds started a hare,
and ran it to a thicket, large and strong, in which thicket the
prince found a virgin, beautiful, most devout, and given up
to divine contemplation; and beside her, lying under the
fold of her garments, was the hare, with his face towards
the dogs, and not showing the least signs of fear. The
Prince of Powis, being a very keen sportsman, was not, on
the spur of the moment, so gallant to the lady as he should
have been. He hallooed the dogs on to catch and kill the
hare : the dogs knew better. The more the prince shouted
out, the farther off they got; and as for the huntsman, when
he tried to blow his horn it stuck to his lips. So the prince,
g2
<!-- Leaf 144, Page: 130 -->
having no help for it, accosted the lady, and putting the
usual questions received the following answer, given with
great humility:—That she had been for fifteen years upon
his lands, and in all that time had never before seen the face
of man; that she was the daughter of King Jowchel of
Ireland; and she continued, " Because my father intended me
to be the wife ofa certain great and noble person of Ireland,
I, fleeing from my native soil (God guiding me), came
hither, in order that I might serve God and the spotless
Virgin with my heart and a chaste body till I should die."
The Prince of Powis, in turn, made a rather long speech,—
not longer, however, than any other prince might have made
addressing so beautiful a virgin. This was the pith and
marrowr of his oration :—"I give and present to thee, with a
most willing mind, these my lands for the service of God;
and that they may be a perpetual asylum, refuge, and defence
in honour of thy name, O excellent virgin I " * " This virgin
Monacella (or Melangell), so very pleasing to God, passed
her solitary life for thirty-seven years in the same places; and
the wild fittle hares, just as if they had been tamed, were
about her every day throughout her whole life. During
which time, also, by the aid of the Divine mercy, miracles
and various other favours were not wanting to those who
asked for her aid, and sought her favour with inward devotion
of heart." There is in the church of Pennant Melangel
curious carved woodwork, representing the legend of St.
Monacella.*


One more hermit, and he of the twelfth century, St.
Caradoc.f He was a native of Brecknockshire, of gentle
blood, and served long and faithfully Rhys, prince of South
Wales. He had the misfortune to lose two of the prince's
favourite greyhounds: his tried honesty and fidelity did not
save him from cruel threats, whereupon he formed his
resolution on the spot, and rebuking his royal master's
ingratitude, went straight to Llandaff. The bishop gave him the
tonsure, and he served in the cathedral. Thence he retired
to the church of St. Kined, " at that time in a manner
abandoned, so that he was three days employed in clearing the

churchyard of thorns and briers before he could make his
way into the church. Here he built himself a cottage, and
lived in strict seclusion, till he was summoned to Menevia to
receive priest's ordination." The good saint loved solitary
places better than cities : the world would have had him,
but he would not have the world. So, as soon as he could
get away, he went to the Isle of Ary. He had not been
long there before Norwegian pirates landed, and carried off
Caradoc and his companions. With their captives on board,
the pirates sailed with a fair wind all night, but to their
surprise found themselves, when day dawned, not a cables
length from the island. The pirates' hearts smote them, so
that they landed Caradoc and his friends, and set them free.
But Ary was no safe abode for Caradoc. Thus thought the
Bishop of St. David's, who took a deep interest in, and
always had his eye on, the saint. This wise and considerate
prelate discovered a suitable place for him within the
precincts ofthe monastery Ismael, in the province of Rhos,
Pembrokeshire. Here, with occasional molestations from the
Flemings, who, a very religious people themselves, had the
not uncommon infirmity of being rather intolerant towards
any religion which differed a hair's-breadth from their own,—
here Caradoc continued till his death, of which he had
intimation by an angel in a vision, and which happened, as he
had foretold, on Low Sunday, April 1124. His body was
interred with great honour in the cathedral of St. David's.
William of Malmesbury flourished in the first half of the
twelfth century, and was consequently a contemporary of
Caradoc's. William aforesaid, having contracted the habit
of picking and stealing in his literary avocations, went to
Caradoc's tomb, with the felonious intention of cutting off
the saint's finger to keep as a relic; when just as, knife in
hand, he was about to consummate his sacrilege, behold the
fingers of the dead Caradoc closed of themselves, and the
hand drew back. The conscience-stricken monk flung the
knife down, and humbly besought the saint's pardon, which
let us hope that he obtained. The hermitage of Caradoc
was situated in the parish of Haroldstone, near Haverford
West. There is a well there still called St. Caradoc's well;
and in the parish of Roch the remains of a chapel, dedicated
<!-- Leaf 146, Page: 132 -->
in honour of the saint; to mark, perhaps, the spot where his
corpse rested on its journey to St. David's.*

Wales, not poor in hermitages, is very rich in sacred
springs, possessing medicinal virtues less valued than they
deserve to be. With almost all of these fountains is
associated the name and memory of some holy person, to
whose prayers their salutary properties are ascribed. Nor
should this be with us a thing incredible; we read, in John,
{empty}v. 2-4, that " there was at Jerusalem, by the sheep-market,
a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda,
and that an angel went down at a certain season into the
pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the
troubling of the water stepped in, was made whole of
whatsoever disease he had." Here a particular virtue is imparted to
the water by a supernatural cause. A plain man reading this
account in the Bible, and being told that a certain well
owed its healing powers to the prayers of some holy man or
woman, would, knowing " that the effectual fervent prayer
of the righteous availeth much," be disposed, I think, to
credit the statement, rather than not. Whatever is put
forward as a miracle demands rigid investigation; the Jews
searched into the truth of the miracle wrought by our
Saviour on the blind man,t and are not censured for so doing :
but if the investigation being over, the fact stands as it did,
as inexplicable on natural principles as before; in that case
I think it more in accordance with the analogy of faith to
admit a miracle than to reject: there is no harm in believing,
there is no sin in disbelieving.

Let us now turn our steps towards these sacred waters. In
the fifth century there lived a holy maiden, St. Keyna or
Ceneu; and not finding any solitary place to her mind in her
own country, she determined to travel the world over till
she discovered one, which at last she did at Keynsham,
Somersetshire. Nobody had ever lived, or could ever live
there, so infested was it with snakes and vipers. St. Keyna,
however, turned these serpents into stones, and these ossified
snakes are to be seen in the parish to this day.J " By the

admonition of an angel, the holy maid returned to the place
of her nativity, where, on the top of a hillock, seated at the
foot ofa high mountain, she made a little habitation for herself;
and, by her prayers to God, obtained a spring there to flow
out of the^earth, which, by the merits of the holy virgin,
affordeth health to divers infirmities. The Mount of St.
Michael is the name of a hill near Abergavenny, which still
retains its sacred character. In the same neighbourhood is
the parish of Llangeneu, in which, according to Mr.
Theophilus Jones, is to be found the well of the saint; and the
situation of her oratory may yet be traced."

The history of St. Wenefrede's well, who knows not ?
How the holy maid, niece to St. Beuno, was passionately
loved by Prince Caradoc; and how, when the chaste virgin
rejected his advances with horror and fled, the love of the
prince turned to hatred, and he pursued after and overtook her,
and cut off her head with his sword; and " how the severed
head took its way down the hill, and stopt near the church;
the valley, which from its uncommon dryness was heretofore
called Sychnant, lost its name; a spring of uncommon size
burst from the place where the head rested; the moss on its
sides diffused a fragrant smell; how her blood spotted the
stones, which annually commemorate the fact, by assuming
colours unknown to them at other times; how St. Beuno
took up the head, carried it to the corpse, and offering up his
devotions, joined it nicely to the body, which instantly
reunited, the place being visible only by a slender white line
encircling her neck."f It is objected to the antiquity of
this legend, that in the Domesday Book no mention is made
of church or well, though places of less note are named.
Considering the existing hostility between the Welsh and
the English, the silence of the Domesday Book is not
surprising. Mr. Pennant thinks " that the legend of St.
Wenefrede was known previous to that survey; for the very name,
Holy Well, is Saxon, probably bestowed on it before the
Conquest, on account of the imputed sanctity of the well."
The name is Saxon, and part ofthe history, I imagine, Saxon
also. I distinguish the line — I should not call it a white
line — that separates the original beautiful legend, and its  
  
  
  t Pennant's Whitefourd and Holy WeU, pp. 225-229.
<!-- Leaf 148, Page: 134 -->
embellishment, at the crimson moss. All up to that inclusive
I take to be Welsh, all beyond Saxon. To apply my rule to
these miracles, there can be no harm in believing the Welsh
legend, no sin in disbelieving the Saxon sequel. The waters
of St. Wenefrede's well are indisputably endowejLwith every
good quality attendant on cold baths. She "ms equally
propitious to Protestants and Roman Catholics, for amongst
the offerings are to be found grateful testimonies from the
patients of each religion." I am happy to hear that the
saint is of myr way of thinking. I will pay especial devotion
to her for the future, and say, as I do now, Sancta Wenefrede
ora pro nobis. The Gothic arched canopy of this far-famed
well dates, it is thought, from the fifteenth century. There is, I
learn,* "in one ofthe sweetest valleys in Denbighshire, near
to where the Elwy, after emerging from the bosom of the
hills, makes its way into the vale of Clwd," a Ffynnon
Vair, another holy well. The ruined chapel which covers it
is dedicated to the Blessed Lady; and in the opinion of the
author of this elegantly written and feeling contribution, has
been built at different times, the earliest later than the
twelfth century.


From these lonely and sequestered spots, I pass on to
others in which the same spirit of pious recollection energised
in a wider sphere. It is impossible to read the accounts of the
early monastic institutions in Wales, without being struck by
the grandeur of ideas, the talents for organisation, the
administrative capacities, and marvellous knowledge of human nature,
displayed by the founders. Read St. David's rule at his
house, Rosevale, MeWda; St. Kentigern's, at his at Llanelwy.
Everybody is employed at that particular work for which he
is best fitted; there is no idleness, no disorder, no irreverence.
We, who have been at sea all our lives, and are no nearer
port now about great social questions, might learn, if we were
not too proud, some wise lessons from these poor despised
monks. There are manifold abuses incidental to institutions
of this kind, and none ought to be allowed except under
strict episcopal supervision and control; still I see, or think that
I see, in the monastic principle, a breakwater against the
revolutionary spirit. It speaks not to the ear only, but also  
  
  
  * Arch. Camb. vol. ii. p. 261.
<!-- Leaf 149, Page: 135 -->
to the eye, which receives impressions more vividly and retains
them longer, the natural equality of man. The spectator
beholds men and women who had everything al command
which the world could give, and knew not what it was to
have a wish ungratified; kings and queens, nobles and
warriors, prelates and statesmen, forsaking the pomps and
vanities ofthe world, taking upon them the form of servants,
and becoming obedient even unto death for Christ's sake.
The growing taste for archæology has led to the collection
of many interesting details relating to the ancient Welsh
monasteries. I will endeavour to find room for a brief notice
of three or four.


About six miles* from the rocky and dangerous coast of
Caernarvonshire, rises an island anciently called Ynis-Enlli,
the Isle of the Current, from the rapid stream that sets in
between it, and the lofty promontory that juts out towards it
from the mainland. In the calmest weather the voyage,
short as it is, is far from pleasant, and in bad weather it is
very dangerous and often impracticable. Such a spot would
be the very last on which a modern colonist would fix, but it
possessed the highest recommendations to the recluses of
ancient days. Accordingly, this island is believed to have
been inhabited from a very remote period by the Culdees,
the prototypes of British hermits. The Bards, first to escape
the oppressions of the Romans, and afterwards of other
invaders, fled thither; hence the island received the name
which it still preserves — Bardsey. At the beginning ofthe
sixth century, a few years before the Synod of Brevi, Cadvan,
accompanied by a number of religious persons, emigrated to
Wales from Armorica, attracted by the solitude and serenity
of Bardsey, guarded by the wild waves of the Atlantic. He
made that island his home, and there founded a monastery.
The second abbot, if Cadvan be reckoned the first, was
Lleudath or Laudatus. He is said to have refused to attend
the Synod of Brevi; whether from age and infirmities, or that
he was not a good sailor, or that he loved peace and quietness,
or that he inclined to Pelagianism,—whatever may have been
the reason of his absence, we may be sure that he was well  
  
  
  * Arch. Camb. vol. ii. p. 53.
<!-- Leaf 150, Page: 136 -->
  
  m

employed at home; for Lleudad was a good man and an
exemplary abbot, praise borne out by the following legend :—
\"At the foundation of the monastery of this island the Lord
God, who attendeth to the petition of the just, at the earnest
request of holy Laudatus, the first abbot, entered into a
covenant with that holy man, and miraculously confirmed
His promise unto him and his successors, the abbots and
monks for ever, while they should continue to lead holy and
religious lives; that they should die by succession : that
is, that the oldest should go first, like a shock of corn
ripe for the sickle. Being thus warned of the approach of
death, each of them, therefore, should watch, as not knowing
at what exact hour the thief might come; and being thus
always prepared, each of them by turns should lay aside his
earthly form."* This foreknowledge unhappily led to
confidence and careless living; and the monks thus proving
unworthy of the privilege, the rule was rescinded, and they
were left to share the common lot of mankind. Still the
belief existed so late as the twelfth century, since we find
Giraldus mentions it, who, by the way, speaks very slightly
and coldly of Bardsey, as a court divine might. After the
Synod of Brevi, Dubritius, archbishop of Caerleon, having
laid down his pastoral staff, retired to Bardsey to end his days
in prayer and recollection. His example influenced others,
and Bardsey became crowded with devotees : I am afraid to
say how many thousands are reported to have lived and died
there. At the conclusion ofthe Synod of Brevi there appears
to have been a great pilgrimage to Bardsey, from natural
affection, mixed up with sympathy, to see the last of
Dubritius. The journey thither was not then, nor is still, inviting.
A Bard who wrote on the subject of this very pilgrimage,
thus piously and devoutly finishes :—" Let us all pray to the
invisible God, the Lord of all lords, that He will, for the sake
of Jesus and His five wounds, carry us through all difficulties,
and be our support, and then no one need fear."-)- The
translation of the bones of St. Dubritius from Bardsey to
Llandaff, in 1120, by good Bishop Urban, is the only
noticeable circumstance more that falls within my limits. The

present remains of the monastery consist only of a part of
a tower: a great deal more was standing in Mr. Pennant's
time; but three quarters of a century (Pennant's " Tour"
was published 1778) make a considerable difference in a
regularly-worked stone quarry. I append his account: — "From
this part (Abardaron) I once took boat for Bardseye island,
which lies about three leagues to the west. The mariners
seemed tinctured with the piety of the place; for they had
not rowed far before they made a full stop, pulled off their
hats, and offered up a short prayer. After doubling a
headland, the island appeared full in view. We passed under the
lofty mountain which forms one side. After doubling the
further end, we put into a little sandy creek, bounded by
low rocks, as is the whole level part. On landing I found
all this tract a very fertile plain, and well cultivated, and
productive of everything which the mainland affords. The
abbot's house is a large stone building, inhabited by several
of the natives. Not far from this is a singular chapel or
oratory, being a long arched edifice, with an insulated stone
altar near the east end. In this place one of the inhabitants
reads prayers. All other offices are performed at Aberdaron.
The British name of the island is Ynys-Enlli, or the Island
ofthe Current, from the fierce current which rages
particularly between it and the mainland. The Saxons named it
Bardseye, probably from the Bards, who retired here,
preferring solitude to the company of invading foreigners."*

Llancarvan, in Glamorganshire, is sometimes called a
college, sometimes a monastery: as education was a leading
branch of duty in the Welsh monasteries, either term is
applicable. This famous institution was founded in the fifth
century, by Meurig ap Tewdrig. Dubritius, archbishop of
Caerleon, was its first head, to whom succeeded Cattwg, or
Cadoc :t he was the son ofa prince of South Wales, and a
very distinguished scholar and Bard : he wrote in the style of
the Book of Proverbs, and many of his maxims and wise
sayings survive. Taliesin was a pupil of Cattwg at Llancarvan,
and on leaving college received from his venerable
preceptor the following valuable advice, which will give an idea
what Cattwg's lectures were like: — "The counsels which  
  
  
  f Williams's Cymry, p. 219.  
  
  
  * Tour, vol. ii. pp. 380-383.
<!-- Leaf 152, Page: 138 -->
Cattwg gave to his scholar Taliesin, the chief of Bards.
Consider before thou speakest; first, what thou speakest;
secondly, why thou speakest; thirdly, to whom thou speakest;
fourthly, concerning whom thou speakest; fifthly, what will
come of what thou speakest; sixthly, what will be the benefit
of what thou speakest; seventhly, who may be listening to
what thou speakest. Place thy word on the end of thy
finger before thou speakest it, and turn it these seven ways
before thou speakest it, and no harm will ever result from
what thou speakest. These were addressed by Cattwg
Ddoeth to Taliesin, the chief of Bards, when he was giving
him his blessing."* Not less charitable indeed than wise in
thought and word, Cattwg " hospitably entertained all such
as resorted to him, and by the means of some part of his
estate, which he had reserved for that use, he supplied no less
than a hundred clerics, a hundred other poor men, and as
many poor widows, with their daily food."*]- Cattwg had
also as a pupil, St. Iltutus, who later in life himself became
the head of a celebrated college, to which scholars flocked
from all parts. Cattwg in his youth had followed the court
of King Arthur, among whose train of gallant knights he is
commemorated in a Triad, on account of his " righteous
discretion." In another Triad he is honoured, under his
second but not less meritorious character, as " one of the
three blessed youth-trainers of the Isle of Britain." J Gildas
the historian was a member ofthe college of Llancarvan, and
in the absence of Cattwg taught for one year with high credit.
While there he copied a book ofthe Gospels — I wish that
he had never written anything else—which was regarded
as one of the great show-treasures ofthe monastery. This
circumstance is mentioned in the " Sure Hope of
Reconciliation," the second essay of my former series. Llancarvan lies
in a small and beautiful valley, surrounded by woody heights;
it is distinguished as the birthplace of Caradoc, the Welsh
historian. Nothing is known of his life; his writings consist
of a history of Wales from the middle of the seventh to the
middle of the twelfth century : his book was in high repute,
copies being preserved at the two great monasteries,Ystrad* Williams's Cymry, p. 221. f Britannia Sancta, vol. i. p. 73.

fflur and Conway. The work was frequently transcribed;
unfortunately, the copyists were not so careful as they should
have been, and there are said to be considerable variations in
the MSS.*


From the sixth—by necessity rather than choice—I
descend to the eleventh century. In the most beautiful partof
a county celebrated for beautiful scenery, the county of
Cardigan, is a remarkable bridge, which, springing from rock to
rock, spans at a dizzy height the torrent which runs beneath.
This fine example of masonry is very unjustly, and very
inconsistently, ascribed to the devil,— Satan never having been
known to do a good-natured thing since his fall; whereas, to
put this bridge down here, just where it was most wanted, and
at so much cost and trouble, was a very good-natured thing
indeed. The monks of the Cistercian abbey of Ystradfflur were
the architects and masons, to whose skill and labour we are
indebted; and now let us go aud look the good monks up.t About
1080, Rhys ap Tewdwr, prince of South Wales, then not far
from ninety years old, founded a religious house at a place now
called " Hen Monachlog," the old abbey on the banks ofthe
river Flur. Rhys was one of the bravest and best of Welsh
princes ofthe eleventh century. He was elected Prince of
South Wales in 1077, and, what was very rare indeed, united
to the voice ofthe people an indefeasible title to the crown by
descent; consequently, he held his patrimonial dominions
several years without molestation. Caradoc J is in
admiration at this pacific phenomenon, and says that " it had been
seldom known before." I should sayr that the contemporary
reigning prince of North Wales had also a clear title
independent of election, which coincidence was the more striking.
To relieve the wearisome monotony of a prolonged
tranquillity, in 1086 a rebellion broke out, headed by some Welsh
chieftains of royal blood, and tailed " by a great number of
licentious and.malecontented people." The rebels had the
public feeling with them, and Rhys, unable to stand against
them, retired to Ireland, whence, having received
reinforcements, he returned. His subjects were as glad to see him
back again as they were to send him away. A battle was  
  
  
  * Rees's South Wales, p. 669. t Roberts's Stratafiorida Abbey.
X Powell's Caradoc, p. 109.
<!-- Leaf 154, Page: 140 -->
fought, and the cause of rightful succession and
constitutional order triumphed. Rhys, having won so signal a
victory, and fearing no- further disturbance, dismissed his Irish
and Scotch auxiliaries with great rewards. In 1090 this
aged and intrepid sovereign died, on the bed on which many
of the Welsh princes expired—the field of battle, fighting
for truth and right against the rebel Jestyn, lord of
Glamorgan, and his Norman knights. Jestyn's breach of faith to his
confederate, Einion, led to the first acquisition of English
subjects in Wales, and the footing which they got they
contrived to keep, though they had a hard matter to do it.
Beyond the fact that Rhys ap Tewdwr built the old abbey
Ystradfflur, nothing more is known ofthe original foundation,
which, I ought to say, itself rests on an ingenious conjecture
ofthe Rev. G. Roberts, in his valuable paper " On
Strataflorida Abbey."


The abbey was resounded, 1164, on a scale of great
magnificence, by Rhys ap Gruffyd, sovereign prince of South
Wales. Rhys had one absorbing principle of life, to drive
the English out of Wales; to this grand object all his
energies were directed : brilliant but temporary success rewarded
his efforts. But that the Normans were as fond of fighting
as the Welsh, they must have had a sad time of it. The site
of the new abbey was two miles lower down the stream
than that of the old. The Welsh name, Ystradfflur, means
\"the plains near the Flur;" and the Latin name,
Strataflorida, means " the blooming plains." This royal abbey
became the last resting-place of the princes of South Wales.
Enriched by munificent grants of lands and tithes, presents of
gold, silver, and precious stones, Ystradfflur rose rapidly to a
splendour and magnificence equalled only by the kingly
abbey of Conway, North Wales. Here copies of the most
important national documents were deposited; within its
walls the monarchs of Wales held their councils and
conventions,— the sublime mysteries of religion hallowing patriotic
aspirations for the common liberty, the national honour, and
independence. The abbey having been founded so late as
the twelfth century, there are not many notices to select from.
Cadell, brother ofthe founder, as stanch a Welshman to the
backbone as himself, astonished the Normans, not easily
astonished, by feats of arms. In 1145 he won the castle of
<!-- Leaf 155, Page: 141 -->
Dynevor from Earl Gilbert, made himself master at the
sword's point of the castle of Caermarthen, and worsted the
Normans and Flemings at Llanstephan. Cadell, a gallant
soldier, was also a keen sportsman : in the ardour of the
chase he rode on, with a small train of attendants, nearly to
Tenby, then held by an English garrison. The news spread
that Cadell was hunting in the neighbourhood; he was
waylaid, attacked, and barely escaped with life : his wounds were
long in healing. Tn the solitude of his sick chamber, his eyes
resting on the cross of Christ, and Him crucified upon it, his
thoughts took a new direction. Cadell recovered from his
sickness, put on armour no more; in penitential garb, with
his scallop and his staff, he went on a pilgrimage to the Holy
Land. On his return he joined the brethren at
Strataflorida, and died in the cowl, 1175. In 1197, Rhys ap
Gruffyd, the founder, died, and was buried : Mr. Roberts
says, at Strataflorida; Sir R. C. Hoare, iMr. Fenton, and
others, say at St. David's, where is a fine tomb said to be
his. The Welsh Chronicle pays to his memory this just
tribute:—" This year died the valiant Rhys, prince of South
Wales, the only stay and defence of that part of Wales,—-for
he it was that got them their liberty, and secured it to them.
He often very readily exposed his own life for the defence of
theirs and the country: generally he got the better of his
enemies, and at last brought them either entirely under his
subjection or forced them to quit the country. He was no
less illustrious for his virtuous endowments than for his valour
and extraction; so that it was with good reason that the
British Bards and others wrote so honourably of him, and so
mightily deplored his death." Rhys was a munificent
supporter of Bardism; he knew that there, as in a shrine guarded
from every profane hand, was treasured the germ of freedom.
In 1176, Rhys made a very great feast at Christmas, at his
castle of Abertivi, which he caused to be proclaimed through
all Britain, Ireland, and the islands adjacent, some
considerable time before. Many hundreds of English, Normans, and
others, coming to Abertivi, were very honourably received
and courteously entertained by Prince Rhys. And among
deeds of arms, and other shows, Rhys caused all the poets of
Wales to come thither; and provided chairs to be set in his
hall, where they should dispute together, to try their cunning
<!-- Leaf 156, Page: 142 -->
and gift in their faculties, where great rewards and rich gifts
were appointed for the overcomers, amongst whom they of
North Wales won the prize; and among the musicians, Rhys's
own household men were counted best.* I have broken
bounds once already to follow Llywelyn the Great into the
thirteenth century, and must do so again.

In 1138 this truly illustrious prince, his body paralysed,
his mind strong and active, as Lord Paramount of Wales,
summoned all the lords and barons of the North and South
to Ystradfflur, where each of them swore to remain true and
faithful subjects, and did homage to David his son.f The
possessions of this monastery were very large, so copiously
poured the stream of royal piety. The estates of Ystradfflur
\"reached two-thirds of the way to Llandovery, the same
distance to Llancurig, and almost one-third of the way to
Builth."! The monks of Ystradfflur remembered, " Freely
ye have received, freely give;" and so they built throughout
the country, then covered with forests, with few roads and
far between, Yspyttys, or Hospices, where the tired or
benighted traveller might find rest and refreshment both for
body and soul. It was an honour to Catholic Wales to have
welcomed the Cistercians : they were, and are, a simple,
severe (to themselves), pious, charitable race.


In the northernmost part of Monmouthshire,§ in the
sequestered vale of Ewyas, embosomed in the Hatterell Hills,
part of the range of the Black Mountains, stands a
magnificent ruin, one of the most splendid of the conventual remains
ofthe Principality, Llanthony Priory. Founded 1110, this
priory continued to that fatal epoch which witnessed the
downfal of monasticism in England and Wales, and
perversion of all those wise and generous provisions which ourCa

t Gryffydh was Llywelyn's eldest son, but he had been in arms
against his father, and was then confined in a fortress. This poor prince
never tasted freedom more. Long imprisoned by the jealousy of the
reigning sovereign, his younger brother, he was at length transferred to
King Henry III., who shut him up in the Tower of London. Thence as
he was attempting to escape, by letting himself down from a window, the
line broke when he was halfway from the bottom, and he was killed bv
the fall. ~ '

<!-- Leaf 157, Page: 143 -->
tholic ancestors had designed to have perpetuated for the
spiritual and temporal benefit of generations yet unborn. The
first thirty years of the existence of Llanthony are the most
eventful; within that period, indeed, it may be said to have
run its course, beginning as a little hermitage, growing up
into a stately edifice, and then dwindling away into a
neglected, forlorn, dilapidated building. The beauty and
solitude ofthe vale of Ewyas had attracted thither a great ascetic
of the sixth century. A lowly chapel in ruins, covered with
moss and ivy, marked, to the beginning ofthe twelfth century,
the identical spot where St. David had been wont to kneel and
pray. About 1100, William — his surname is unknown — a
retainer of Hugh de Lacy, a Norman knight in the reign of
William Rufus, was hunting in the Black Mountains, when
by chance, or a providential direction, he found himself in
the vale of Ewyas. Heated and tired, he laid down on the
grass in a shady place. As he lay, his eyes wandered over
the winding valley, the lofty mountains, the dark forests,
which then clothed the heights; there was a stillness, broken
only by the hoarse voice of the torrent which swept along.
Amid scenes like these the human mind is attuned to
heavenly haimonies; the musing hunter lifted up his eyes, and
espied the chapel of St. David; his resolution was taken —
he vowed to become a hermit, and, dismissing his companions,
a hermit he became. This change seems very abrupt to us,
but it was more common then, and less thought of. William
laid upon himself severe penances for his sins, real or
imaginary. Stripping himself of the clothing he usually wore, he
put on a hair shirt instead, and because his armour was hard
and heavy, he did not leave that off, but kept it on till it was
worn out with age and rust. William lived thus several
years, and widely spread was the fame of the hermit of
Llanthony, and many there were who came to see and converse
with him. Among others there came Ernisi, ehaplain to
Maude, queen of Henry. He had once lived a hermit
himself, near the forest of Canothus; and when he saw and spoke
with William, his old thoughts came back again, and he
begged William to receive him as a companion and sharer in
St. David's cell. William consented, aud the two hermits

dwelt together in one heart and in one mind. It grieved them
to see St. David's chapel in ruins, so they set about to repair
<!-- Leaf 158, Page: 144 -->
it; and their reparation went on with so hearty a good-will,
that when they had finished it they found that they had got
a new church altogether, though small and homely, like its
predecessor. This church, in 1108, Urban, bishop of
Llandaff, and Rameline, bishop of Hereford, solemnly dedicated
to the honour of St. John the Baptist. Mr. Roberts
conjectures the present parish church of Llanthony to be the very
church built by the two hermits.

Hugh de Lacy, William's old master, did not lose sight
of him. This Hugh de Lacy was a good man, of a good
stock; his father had built and endowed a monastery. Hugh
was also rich, and childless; so if he chose to spend his money
in promoting religion, no one had any business to find fault
with him. Hugh would fain have endowed the hermits with
lands and tithes, but they would not take them : they had left
the world, and were loth that the world should follow them
to their peaceful vale with its cares and deceitfulness of riches.
After a while, it occurred to Ernisi that it would be a pity
that their good design should die with them. He proposed
to William to form a conventual society; William was strongly
against this at first, but afterwards consented. Archbishop
Anselm, before whom the plan was laid, approved of it. Now
Hugh de Lacy was happy; the recluses must take his money
to build their house and its appurtenances; and they did so.
The Order they fixed on for their abbey was that of the Canons
Regular of St. Augustine. William, who had been admitted
to priest's orders shortly after he became a hermit, and Ernisi,
invited God-fearing men from the convents of Merton and
Trinity, near London and Colchester, to join them. So soon
as they had got together a few members, and were perfect in
the knowledge of the monastic duties, they presented Ernisi
for the approbation of the bishop, to be Superior, who was
confirmed in his office. The date of this event was about 1110.
Ernisi was a wise and prudent head, — "frequent in prayers
and preaching, constant in fasting, courteous in entertaining
strangers, and in every respect qualified for the government
of his flock; for that which he taught in word he confirmed
by good works."

They had many visitors of high degree; among others,
Roger, bishop of Salisbury, the king's prime minister, came,
and gave such a glowing description on his return, as to
<!-- Leaf 159, Page: 145 -->
enlist the sympathy of the king, the queen, and of the whole
court. Bishop Roger was a great church builder and had a
very fine taste, and, it is thought, gave to the new priory at
Llanthony a helping hand. In the meanwhile, Ernisi was
quite overwhelmed with kindness; gifts were constantly coming
in, of which the zealous dispensers would take no denial.
In vain Ernisi pleaded that the monastery would be richer
without the lands offered than with them; that it was better
to dwell poor in the house of God, than be entangled in
litigious suits. The king and queen offered the monastery freely
the whole country of Bergely, and the arduous task of refusing
without giving offence was delicately performed by Ernisi,
who had not lived about court for nothing. Queen Maud
visited Llanthony, and, struck with the singular self-denial of
William, made a request that a queen, and no woman else,
might make to a hermit,—She once desired he would give
her leave to put her hand into his bosom : he submitted; the
hand stealthily conveyed a purse, intended for his own
necessities; but William had or knew of none, so he applied
the gift to adorn his church. The next memorable event is
the admission of two new members, Walter de Gloucester,
earl of Hereford and constable of England, the one, and
Robert de Betun the other.


There is on record an account of the arrival of the latter,
written by William de Wycombe. " When he arrived at
the foot of the mountain they call Hatteril, night had already
shut in the day; a wintry snow covered the roads. With a
soul glowing with religious ardour, he leaves behind him his
companions and horses, unable to cross the mountain. He
draws off his boots and abandons them. The pathway was
narrow, winding, rough with rocks, and filled with snow.
He ascends slowly, sounding the' road with his staff. As
often as the snow deceives his footsteps he falls out of the
pathway, from worse to worse, rolling over and over, until
arrested by the roots of the trees. After a short time, having
regained his breath, he stretches out his arms, like one
swimming, and, shaking off the mass of snow, creeps on hands and
knees until he surmounts the height and recovers the road.
In this manner, not once, but often, he fell and rose again.
And now at last he attains the summit of the mountain,
where the upright shaft of a cross offers a place of rest."  
  
  
  H
<!-- Leaf 160, Page: 146 -->
By this time the good man's ardour was a little damped, and
he was in two minds whether to return or go forward;
rejecting the first thought as a suggestion of Satan, he began
to descend into the valley. " Alternately falling upon his
back and face, he makes his way to the point where the
abrupt mountain side descends, by a gentle slope, into the
vale below; thence he hears the chiming of the bells to
vespers in the church beneath him, and refreshed, as though
by strains of divine harmony, accomplishes the remainder of
his journey with cheerfulness, leaving the traces of his
lacerated footsteps in blood upon the snow. The benighted
guest knocks at the door of the porter's lodge, is recognised,
and admitted. The brethren meet him with lanthorns and
conduct him to the house." A few years after the
reception of the Earl of Hereford and Robert de Betun, Ernisi,
first Prior of Llanthony, died. Robert de Betun was chosen
as his successor. He did not continue long in an office the
duties of which he discharged with the strictest fidelity. In
1129 Robert de Betun was nominated Bishop of Hereford,
but was not consecrated till 1131, and then much against his
will. His successor at Llanthony was Robert de Braci.


Llanthony had seen her bright days — dark days were at
hand. King Henry I. of England died, December 1135.
His sagacious mind and strong hand had kept everything in
its place; now disorders and convulsions followed, aggravated
by the calamity of a disputed succession in the rival claims
of the Empress Matilda and Stephen. The Welsh were in
arms, and the tranquillity of the beautiful vale of Ewyas was
wofully marred by the passage of hostile chieftains, the
pursued and the pursuer. One day a whole Welsh family fled
to Llanthony for sanctuary; their enemies followed them, even
into the sacred precincts, and fought in the outer court. The
fugitive and his household, with their wives and children,
very naturally rushed into the house, and took possession of
the refectory. I do not see where better they could have
gone. In the excitement of the moment they found vent for
their feelings in singing their national hymns, with which the
monks, not understanding a word they said, were scandalised
beyond measure. This was a transient vexation; but when,
as very soon was the case, their supply of provisions was cut
off, things began to look very serious. They made their
<!-- Leaf 161, Page: 147 -->
situation known to their old prior, the Bishop of Hereford.
He, in burning indignation with himself for having
forgotten them, returned instantly a most pressing entreaty to
them to come at once to Hereford, where he had a house,
chapel, granges, and cellars, at their service. The monks of
Llanthony did not wait to be asked twice; leaving barely
sufficient of their number to perform the offices and say mass,
they made the best of their way to Hereford. Being
persecuted in one city, as their reverend annalist relates, they fled
to another; from the empty larder at Llanthony to the full
cellars of Hereford. With their kind friend, Robert de
Betun, the monks of Llanthony spent two happy years. At
the expiration of which, at the request ofthe Bishop
ofHereford, Earl Milo, son of the earl who died a monk at Llanthony,
gave them a site on which to build a temporary provisional
house, till such times as they could return safely to Llanthony,
on which their affections were set. Thus a daughter
Llanthony, dedicated to the Blessed Lady, rose at Gloucester, on
a piece of land called Hyde, just outside the city of
Gloucester, near the left bank of the river Severn.


At first the monks of St. Mary's trod in the steps of their
predecessors, the ascetic children of St. John the Baptist, and
edified the whole city by unexampled rigours. But the Earls of
Hereford began to heap on them—truth to say, unresisting —
lands, benefices, and wealth. Great barons did them the honour
to come and dine with them, and the dainties liberally provided
in compliment to their noble guests continued to smoke on
the refectory board long after the guests had departed. Robert
de Braci died at Gloucester, 1137, to whom succeeded
William de Wycombe, who wrote a memoir of Robert de
Betun, which the reader will find in the valuable appendix
to Mr. Roberts's compact pamphlet on Llanthony Priory.
All this time not a word was said about going back to
Llanthony. I must own the subject was distasteful. The
beautiful vale of Ewyas was, in the eyes ofthe Gloucester monks,
most beautiful, while distance lent enchantment to the view.
Did any unfortunate new-comer venture to drop a hint about
returning, red grew the face ofthe venerable superior; a
sympathetic glow mantled the cheeks ofthe reverend brethren; a
subdued whisper, " Would that every stone in the old priory
were a stout hare !" growing bold by sufferance, swelled into
<!-- Leaf 162, Page: 148 -->
a loud chorus, " Would that the church and all its offices
were sunk at the bottom of the seal" Fact, dear reader; the
degenerate monks did say those very words. In the meanwhile
many carts and waggons went and came from old Llanthony
—went empty and returned full, to the indignation of the
monks of the mother-church. An eye-witness writes, the
daughter-house " permitted the monastery to be reduced to
such poverty, that the inmates had no surplices, and were
compelled to perform the offices of the church against the
custom and rules of the order. Sometimes they had no
breeches, and could not with decency attend divine service.
Sometimes one day's bread must serve for two, while the
monks at Gloucester enjoyed superfluities." These canons
were incorrigible. Being asked if they were not ashamed
not even to leave priests enough to sing mass as it ought to
be sung, they would answer, " Who would go and sing to
the wolves? do the whelps of wolves delight in loud music?"
So the work of spoliation went on; the library was robbed of
its books, the storehouse of its vestments embroidered with
gold and silver, the muniment-room of its deeds and charters,
the treasury of all its valuables. Even the bells were carried
awaj' to Gloucester. This destruction continued for seventy
years, though within a few years after the monks had begun
to strip old Llanthony, Clement, the prior at Gloucester, a
learned scholar, sound divine, and honest, straightforward
man, having carried through a reformation, — not before it
was wanted — at Gloucester, tried to revive Llanthony.
Accordingly he announced, that for the future the whole
community, thirteen monks and the sub-prior excepted,
should keep residence every year at the mother priory. Had
the knell of doom sounded in their ears, it would not have
come fraught with more appalling terrors to the Gloucester
monks. However they submitted, and for several years, year
after year, the weeping canons plodded their weary way over
the steep, rough roads of Monmouthshire, to the no longer
delectable, but detestable, vale of Ewyas. But human
endurance has its limits. One memorable year the whole
community, with one voice, declared that they would not
move a foot. Clement gave his praiseworthy design up,
with these emphatic words, in which, long before this, I trust,
that he has discovered himself to have been a false prophet,
<!-- Leaf 163, Page: 149 -->
—" We shall all go to hell for the sake of St. John." This
picture ofthe lights and shadows of monasticism I will finish
with a beautiful sonnet, copied into the " Archæol. Camb."

Giraldus.

Giraldus de Barri,* fourth son of William de Barri, a
Norman knight, who held lands in Wales, by Angharad, his
wife, granddaughter to Rhys ap Theodor or Tudor,
sovereign prince of South Wales, was born about 1146, at the
family seat, Manorbeer Castle, Pembrokeshire. He early
gave indications ofa thoughtful and serious disposition; when
a child, while his brothers built castles in the sand, he traced
out churches and monasteries. His father, an observant man,
decided on giving him a learned education, and in joke used
to call him his little bishop. Once when Manorbeer was  
  
  
  * Hoare's Giraldus, vol. i. pp. xi.-lxxii. Camb. Plut. pp. 146-172.
<!-- Leaf 165, Page: 151 -->
threatened with an attack, and others flew to arms, Giraldus
begged to be carried to the church; thus, as himself said
afterwards, " with a wonderful foresight for his age, declaring
the peace and privileges ofthe house of God." With all his
father's excellent intentions, book-learning did not prosper at
Manorbeer. To learn to use the sword and lance were the
chief studies prosecuted there; so his uncle Fitzgerald,
bishop of St. David's, kindly took young Giraldus to live
with him, and be educated under his directions. His tutors
at first did not find him a very promising pupil, but as they
not only thought him stupid but told him so, his wounded
pride spurred on his hitherto undeveloped faculties, and he
soon became the best scholar they had. From St. David's
he went to Paris, where he stayed three years, gave lectures
on rhetoric and the belles lettres, and was held up by the
Dons as a model student.


In 1172 he was ordained and presented to preferment,
both in England and Wales, a canonry at Hereford, and the
living of Chesterton, Oxfordshire. From the time that he
solemnly dedicated himself to the work of the ministry to his
dying day, Giraldus's whole thoughts were turned to the
good of the church in Wales, to raise the tone of religious
feeling and practice, which, in his rather fastidious judgment,
had fallen very low, and to vindicate the just rights and
authority of his native episcopate. As stanch a supporter
ofthe right divine of tithes as, in our days, is the learned
and zealous vicar of Harlow, Giraldus carried his complaints,
that the church did not receive her dues, to the Archbishop
of Canterbury, and was by him appointed his legate in Wales,
to rectify these and other abuses. The legate entered upon his
duties in right earnest, and proclaimed martial law — that is,
he excommunicated, without mercy, those who refused to pay
up their tithes: every one paid except the men of Rhos, the
Flemings,—I hope, for the sake of the excellent rector of
Rhos Crowther, that they have learnt better now. Neither did
Giraldus spare the clergy, he was particularly severe against
such as were married; he called their wives " concubines,"
and insisted on their dismissal. At Brecknock he found an
old archdeacon " cohabiting publicly with his concubine,"—
that is, living in all good conscience with his lawful wife, as
any other archdeacon might do. The old man turned a deaf
<!-- Leaf 166, Page: 152 -->
ear to the legate's remonstrances and threats, who at length
put him out of his preferments, and, at the request of the
archbishop, accepted them himself, and so became
Archdeacon of Brecon. Set a black mark against Giraldus's
name for this. To send the poor old archdeacon adrift,
because he would not forsake the wife of his bosom, was a
burning shame.


One of the earliest acts of the new archdeacon was a
spirited assertion ofthe rights ofthe see of St. David. The
church of Keri* stood on the borders of St. David's and St.
Asaph, but belonged to the former; the Bishop of St. Asaph
intimated his intention to take possession of Keri, and the
whole territory between the Wye and the Severn. The
meditated aggression came to the ears of Giraldus; he
immediately despatched messengers to two Welsh princes,
Einion Clyd and Cadwalhon, begging them to send him
some armed horsemen, as it was reported that the intrusive
prelate would be attended by a strong body of men from
Powis. Having taken this precaution, he set out two days'
journey to Keri, which he reached on a Sunday morning.
The Keri clergy sided with the Bishop of St. Asaph, and hid
the keys of the church; they were found at last, and the
archdeacon entered the church, ordered the bells to be rung,
and celebrated mass with great solemnity. Presently
messengers arrived to announce the approach of the Bishop of
St. Asaph to the dedication of the church of Keri. Giraldus,
therefore, sent a deputation of the clergy, with his best
respects, to the bishop, saying that he should be most happy
to receive him as a friend and neighbour, but that if he had
any other object in coming, he recommended him to keep
away. The bishop sent answer that he was coming, as bishop
of the diocese, to the dedication of the church of Keri. The
bishop arrived at the gate of the churchyard, placed his
mitre on his head, and with his pastoral staff in his hand,
and preceded by his processional cross, advanced towards the
sacred edifice. As the bishop entered the churchyard, the
great doors of the church were thrown wide open, and the
archdeacon issued forth with a train of clergy in theirvest
* A village in Montgomeryshire, between Bishop's Castle and
Newtown.
<!-- Leaf 167, Page: 153 -->
ments, lighted tapers in their hands, and the up-raised crucifix.
The antagonistic authorities met face to face, and stood foot
to foot, and cross to cross. The bishop, in a loud voice,
began to excommunicate the archdeacon; the archdeacon, in
a still louder voice, began to excommunicate the bishop.
The artillery ofthe church was at the command ofthe
archdeacon, he used it with decisive effect. When Giraldus had
finished, the bells rung out, the bishop turned on his heel,
mounted his horse, and, accompanied by his attendants,
galloped away, amidst a shower of mud and stones. I should
suppose, that what is called the Dedication meant the feast
or anniversary of the Dedication, which is always an occasiou
of great solemnity. You would think, perhaps, that Giraldus
and the bishop were at daggers drawn the rest of their lives;
not so, they had been fellow-students at Paris. The Bishop
of St. Asaph laughed as heartily as any one at his defeat, and
the two remained as good friends as ever.

I have not space to follow Giraldus's history seriatim,
and hasten on to the most interesting part of it. On the
death of his uncle, the Bishop of St. David's, in 1176, the
chapter met and elected the Archdeacon of Brecon to be his
successor; but he declined to accept the bishopric till the
vacancy had been announced in the usual manner, and the
king's consent had been obtained. The chapter stood on
their rights, to the great displeasure of Henry II., who
referred the choice of a successor to the judgment of the
Archbishopof Canterbury and his suffragans; they unanimously
recommended Giraldus, and the king as decidedly refused to
confirm him. " He was," the sagacious Henry said, " too
conscientious, too active, too nearly related to Prince Rhys,
and, in short, too much ofa Welshman to be trusted with St.
David's." In 1185 Giraldus attended Prince John to Ireland,
as tutor and secretary; here he was offered, first, the
Bishopric of Ferns, then that of Leichlin, and on his refusing both,
the offer was made of consolidating the two, if he would take
them together. He replied, " If I could improve and exalt the
Church of Ireland, I would willingly accept the proffered
honour; but since that cannot be expected, I had rather
continue a private person than be raised to a high station
in which I can be of no service." While in Ireland he
commenced his " Topography" of that country, which he
<!-- Leaf 168, Page: 154 -->
completed and revised on his return to England. What followed
he shall tell himself, and his account will show to what
perfection the puff' direct had attained in the twelfth century: —

\"Being desirous not to put a lighted candle under a
bushel, but to place it in a candlestick where it might give
light, I determined to recite my work before a public
audience at Oxford, where the clergy were most distinguished
for their talents and learning. I accordingly recited, for
three successive days, the three chapters into which the book
is divided. On the first day I entertained with hospitality
Ihe poor people of the town; on the second, the doctors of
the different professions, and the students of the greatest
celebrity; and on the third, the remainder of the scholars,
with the burghers, and militia of the city. Such a magnificent
and sumptuous festival revived the ancient times of classic
poetry, and was wholly unknown in England either in the
past or present age."

In 1188 Giraldus accompanied Archbishop Baldwin, who
came into Wales, the first Archbishop of Canterbury who
had ever clone so, ostensibly to preach a crusade, actually by
subtilty to take away the birthright of the metropolitan see of
the National Church of Wales. The " Itinerary," the best
known work of Giraldus, gives an account of the archbishop's
journey through Wales. Giraldus preached the Crusade, he
tells us, with extraordinary eloquence and immense success;
he took the Cross himself, and vowed to go, but did not,—
something unforeseen prevented. About 1190 Giraldus was
so high in favour at court as to be appointed coadjutor to the
Bishop of Ely during King Richard's absence in the Holy
Land. In his coadjutorship the Bishoprics of Bangor and
St. Asaph fell vacant; he was offered either, but refused them
both: his heart was set on his first love, his dear St. David's.
In 1199, on the death of Peter de Leia, the chapter, assembled
under the mandate of Hubert, archbishop of Caterbury,
returned four names,—Giraldus, archdeacon of Brecon;
Walter, abbot of St. Dogmael; Peter, abbot of Whitland; and
Reginald Foliot, an Englishman. The archbishop struck out
the names ofGiraldus, Walter, and Peter, and setting Giraldus
aside altogether, proposed two other names instead of those
of Walter and Peter. The chapter held to their right of
nomination and refused compliance; the matter was submitted
<!-- Leaf 169, Page: 155 -->
to King Richard, who, dying before it was settled, the chapter
presented to King John letters recommendatory in favour of
Giraldus; but the influence of the Archbishop of Canterbury
prevailed, and the application was unsuccessful. Shortly
after this Giraldus revisited St. David's, " where he was
received with the greatest joy both by the clergy and the
people. A convocation was again held for the election of a
bishop, and the votes were unanimous in favour of Giraldus,
who was earnestly requested to go immediately to the court
of Rome, and there to assert the rights of the metropolitan
see of St. David's, and to procure a ratification of his own
election."


Giraldus went to Rome accordingly; the cause lasted
five years, and cost the bishop-elect three journeys to Rome.
At last it was decided against Giraldus on both points; the
election ofthe chapter was declared null and void, and the
jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Canterbury confirmed.
The fatal bar to the acknowledgement of the metropolitan
claims of St. David's was the absence of a pall. Giraldus
maintained that Archbishop Sampson, about 920, flying to
Dole from a pestilence, carried it away with him. But this
removal of the pall is not clearly made out, and the statement
itself reads, like the reproduction of a story connected with
another Sampson, bishop of Dole in the sixth century. It
could not be authenticated that a pall had been sent from
Rome to Menevia, or to any bishop in Britain, before the
mission of Augustine. The absence ofthe pall may be fatal
to the claims of Menevia, upon Roman principles, as against
a Roman Catholic Primate of England, but does not in the
least prejudice those claims as against a Protestant Primate.
The fact proves, not that St. David's is no true and rightful
archbishopric at all, but that she is a true and rightful
archbishopric, and that independent of the Pope, and de jure,
though, unhappily, not defacto, independent of the Archbishop
of Canterbury also.

The election question of the chapter of St. David's was
the great subject of the day into which Welsh politics
were absorbed. The Princes both of North and South
Wales strenuously supported the chapter. The matter, after
a good deal of bribery, corruption, and ratting, ended in the
appointment, with Giraldus's concurrence, of Geoffry de
<!-- Leaf 170, Page: 156 -->
Henelawe, prior of Llanthony, who was consecrated Bishop
of St David's, 1203. Disappointed of the object of his just
ambition, and disgusted with men and things, Giraldus
resigned his preferments in favour of his nephew, Philip de
Barri. He passed the last seventeen years of his life in
Wales, employed in revising his former works, and composing
others. His productions were numerous, an honour to his
age and country; though Paris may have given the finishing
touch to his scholarship, his own St. David's, be it remembered,
grounded and built him up in learning.


The leading acts of his life will open his character to
the intelligent reader. Half Welshman, half Englishman,
Giraldus united the impulsive energy and fire of the one, to
the determination, perseverance, and self-reliance of the other.
He possessed fine talents, and a great aptitude for business;
whatever he undertook he carried through, manfully and
unflinchingly : his weak point was vanity,— those who knew his
weakness and played upon it, beguiled him into not
unfrequent inconsistencies. Thus, with the just and right
conception he had of the validity of the claims of the
metropolitan see of St. David's, he ought not to have accepted
from the Archbishop of Canterbury either the office of legate
or archdeacon, still less should he have accompanied Baldwin
in his aggressive circuit of Wales : but the opportunity these
occasions severally presented of carrying out his reformations,
and displaying his eloquence, distanced all other
considerations. His capacity of swallowing flattery was enormous, and
any one who reads the "Itinerary" will see that the English
courtiers fooled him to the top of his bent. He was a
charitable man : once, while he was staying at Lincoln, the poor
of the city being in great distress, he sold his most costly
vestments to relieve them. He was kind-hearted to his
relatives : on returning from one of his visits to Paris, he
heard that his brother and his wife were on the point of
separation : he immediately procured letters from the
archbishop, and rode post to Winchester, the case being before
that bishop's court. He entered the Chapter-house just as
the sentence of divorce was going to be pronounced. He
produced the letter of the archbishop, and the proceedings
were stayed at his request, which the bishop told him would,
without the primate's letter, have proved warrant sufficient.
<!-- Leaf 171, Page: 157 -->
Giraldus expostulated with the discordant pair so
persuasively and affectionately, that a complete reconciliation
followed, and they lived a united couple ever after. A strict
diciplinarian, perhaps a shade too much so, he was a man of
his word. His own parishioners at Nangle having incurred
excommunication for the deadly sin of keeping back the
tithes, and repented and paid up, he promised to absolve
them on a certain day,—the day came, and with it a
tremendous tempest, which made travelling, as travelling was in
those days, positively dangerous: however, he had passed his
word, and go he would; and he went. As to personal fear, he
did not know what it was,—I suppose that no Welshman
does. During the contest for St. David's, Giraldus was a
marked man, and the royal displeasure was manifested in
every shape it could be: on his return towards England, from
an excursion through the wild parts of Cardiganshire, a
messenger met him with the intelligence that all the lands at
Brecon and Llandeu, belonging to the see of St. David, and
of which he had the management, had been seized on behalf
of the king,—Giraldus went on, notwithstanding; a few miles
further another messenger met him, to say that all his own
lands and revenues would shortly be seized, and that he
himself would be thrown into prison if he could be laid hold
of,—still on he went. When he got near home, his own agent
met him, confirming everything; to all which portentous
announcements Giraldus pleasantly made answer, "Have we
not some good ale at home ? let us go and drink it before it
be all gone." His courage had its reward; on arriving at
Llandeu he found all safe and sound. Giraldus had an
author's lease of life, and saw seventy-four years; shortly
before his death he was offered the once-coveted bishopric
of St. David's, on condition that he acknowledged the
jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Canterbury : he gave a decided
refusal. He died at St. David's, and was buried in the
cathedral church, where his tomb may yet be seen, bearing
his effigy, sculptured in the beautiful and devotional attitude
— the hands clasped in prayer — of the old Catholic
monuments.


A picture of Wales and the W'elsh, copied from the pages
of the "Itinerary," will close this essay, which, as heretofore, I
<!-- Leaf 172, Page: 158 -->
commend to the indulgence of my old and new friends:—" As
the southern part of Wales, near Cardiganshire, and especially
Pembrokeshire, is pleasanter on account of its plains and sea
coast, so North Wales is better defended by nature, is more
productive of men distinguished for bodily strength, and
more fertile in the nature of its soil. For as the mountains
of Eryri (Snowdon) could supply pasturage for all the herds
of cattle in Wales, if collected together, so could the Isle of
Mona (Anglesey) provide a requisite quantity of corn for all
the inhabitants,—on which account there is an old British
proverb, ' Mona is the mother of Wales.' It is to be observed
that the British language is more delicate and richer in
North Wales, that country being less intermingled with
foreigners. The people of Cornwall and the Armoricans
speak a language similar to that of the Britons; it is
intelligible to the Welsh in many instances,—nay, almost in all.
No one of this nation ever begs, for the houses of all are
common to all; and they consider liberality and hospitality
amongst the first virtues. Those who arrive in the morning
are entertained till evening by the conversation of young
women, and the music of the harp. In the evening, when
no more guests are expected, the meal is prepared according
to the number and dignity ofthe persons assembled, and the
wealth of the family who entertains. While the family is
engaged in waiting on the guests, the host and hostess stand
up, paying unremitting attention to everything, and take no
food till all the company are satisfied. The women, after the
manner of the Parthians, cover their heads with a large
white veil, folded together in the form ofa crown. Both sexes
exceed any other nation in attention to their teeth, which they
render like ivory. These people being of a sharp and acute
intellect, and gifted with a rich and powerful understanding,
excel in whatever studies they pursue. Their musical
instruments charm and delight the ear with their sweetness;
in their rhymed songs and set speeches they are so subtle
and ingenious, that they produce in the native tongue
ornaments of wonderful and exquisite inventions, both in the
words and sentences; hence arise tho-e poets whom they call
Bards. The Welsh esteem noble birth and generous descent
above all things, and are therefore more desirous of marrying
<!-- Leaf 173, Page: 159 -->
into good than rich families. Even the common people
retain their genealogy, and can not only readily recount the
names of their grandfathers and great-grandfathers, but even
refer hack to the sixth or seventh generation. The greater part
of their land is laid down to pasturage, little is cultivated, a
very small quantity is ornamented with flowers, and a still
smaller is sown. They seldom yoke less than four oxen to
their ploughs. The boats which they employ in fishing or
in crossing the rivers are made of twigs, not oblong, nor
pointed, but almost round, or rather triangular, covered both
within and without with raw hides. The fishermen, according
to the custom of the country, in going to and from the rivers
carry their boats on their shoulders.

\"In ancient times, and about two hundred years before
the overthrow of Britain, the Welsh were instructed and
confirmed in the faith by Faganus and Daniianus, sent
into the island at the request of King Lucius, by Pope
Eleutherius, and from that period when Germanus of Auxerre
and Lupus of Troyes came over on account of the corruption
which had crept into the island by the invasion of the
Saxons, but particularly with a view of expelling the
Pelagian heresy, nothing heretical or contrary to the true faith
was to be found among the natives. But it is said that some
parts of the ancient doctrines are still retained. They give
the first piece broken off from every loaf of bread to the poor.
They sit down to dinner by three in a company, in honour
of the Trinity; with extended arms, and bowing heads, they
ask a blessing of every monk or priest, or of every person
wearing a religious habit. They desire, above all other
nations, the episcopal ordination and unction, by which the
grace ofthe Spirit is given. Of all pilgrimages they prefer
that to Rome, where they pay the most fervent adoration to
the Holy See. We observe that they show a greater respect
than other nations to churches and ecclesiastical persons, to
the relics of saints, bells, holy books, and the cross, which
they devoutly revere; and hence their churches enjoy more
than common tranquillity. For peace is not only preserved
towards all animals feeding in churchyards, but at a great
distance beyond them. The principal churches to which
antiquity has annexed the greater reverence, extend their
<!-- Leaf 174, Page: 160 -->
protection to the herds so far as they can go to feed in the
morning, and return at night. Hermits and anchorites more
strictly abstinent and more spiritual can nowhere be found;
for this nation is earnest in all its pursuits, and neither
worse men than the bad, nor better than the good, can be
met with. Happy and fortunate would this nation be, nay,
completely blessed, if it had good prelates and pastors, and
but one Prince, and that Prince a good one."
